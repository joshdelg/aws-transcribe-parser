[0:00] Speaker 1: How do various ethnic groups in the Middle East and fertile crescent lead to possible de evolutionary impacts and devolution is the splitting of a country.
[0:09] Speaker 0: Yeah. So Middle East, right? Yep, primarily adroitly kind of the human evolution, right. It originated from kind of that region, like, really? I'm talking about the cousins off years back. It has been very tribal in nature, right? All the culture over there. So, for example, if you think about Iraq, Iraq is there are three primary, I would say groups there there is one which is Gerdes. And then there is Shias and Sunnis. And then they have been fighting each other for so long. And Iraq, for the last many, many years had been ruled by Sunnis. Actually, Sunnis were really kind of minority. But then they were ruling the majority. That's what happened, been dancing. But there's dumps and is Sunni. But the and Sunni, I think, constitutes maybe 15% or so off Iraqi population. But then they were oppressing. She have there were oppressing Kurds and all these folks right now, so think of Iraq. I mean, there's government, but the government doesn't really mean anything. Think of Afghanistan. Same thing. Think off Syria. Same thing. I mean, the only thing that they really do is the oppressed people. The only solution is to use dropped a bar, have peace talks, improved talk on me, parade jobs to the people. If they don't have jobs right there, the only thing they're going to go there and fight, and then it will cause all these conflicts. And all these divisions keep fighting if they don't come out of the travel mentality. And then if there is no way to improve the health of the government and the commission in that part of the world, it is differently. Couldn't do create more chaos and division among existing countries.
[2:06] Speaker 2: So you briefly mentioned the conflict. So what specific conflict can occur between different ethnic groups that can possibly alter the development of that country's?
[2:17] Speaker 0: Yeah, So in Iraq, actually, there's a very old 1000 years, many talking year old religion, conviviality. When the war started to happen, people started to target them based on their religion, is it? No, you're not. You're not Muslim, so you know. Either you forcefully convert to Islam or you just will be from their
[2:37] Speaker 3: ethnic and religious conflicts like between the Kurds and
[2:48] Speaker 0: Kurdistan, which is far off the Iraq, which is northern part of Iraq. Part of Kurdistan is also in Turkey. The problem is that then she hasn't neither. Fighting with Kurds in Iraq, what would they do? They're looking very on the border. So if they can't protect themselves within that country for what they would do, they were naturally border than go out of that country, right? And then what they would do naturally for damages. Hey, let me go to Turkey. Let me just crossed the border with Turkey because the people who live all right on the north side of the border in Turkey Ray, they are there people, they're the same ethnic groups. That's all. What happens is problem. In one country, it starts to know flow into another country. There's actually a country that is really very small country, right? Jordan been doing it that hey, if no country takes you, then you just complete order, I think almost like 30 40% of the population of Jordan refugees right now and when you have these massive number off people who are living in refugee camps in a country that has relieved very, very limited resources. What would really happen? You can't really solve the problem very easily.
[3:59] Speaker 2: And although these problems seem to be getting more difficult by the day, is there a possible way that countries can overcome this? And what are some past to achieve that?
[4:09] Speaker 0: Oh, I think what needs to happen is really rather than every country, individual, country middle is tryingto come up with their own solution. There has to be a broader consensus off all the countries in the region with some kind of oversight of some larger power, like us or Russia or Germany, maybe.
