<h3>[0:08] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Good evening from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Welcome to the first and Onley vice presidential debate of 2020 Sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. I'm Susan Page of USA Today. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy in Kingsbury Hall tonight we have a small and socially distant audience, and we've taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask, and the candidates will be seated 12 ft apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they've agreed to express that enthusiasm Onley twice at the end of the debate. And now when I introduce the candidates, please welcome California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence. Oh, okay. Thank you. Is that the present? Okay, Senator Harris and Vice President Pence, Thank you for being here. We're meeting as president. Trump and the first lady continued to undergo treatment in Washington after testing positive for covert 19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns and the Commission on Presidential Debates have agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I'm here to enforce them on behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching one note, No one in either campaign or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance. What topics all raise or what questions I'll ask. This 90 minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. I'll begin a segment by posing a question to each of you, sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then we'll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say we'll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that ISS civil. These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectful exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let's begin with the ongoing pandemic that has cost our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had Mork overt cases over the past seven days than in the week before. Nine states have set new records. Even if a vaccine is released soon, the next administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden administration due in January and February that a Trump administration wouldn't do? Would you impose new lockdowns for businesses and schools and hotspots? Ah, federal mandate to wear masks. You have two minutes to respond without interruption.</p>
<h3>[3:39] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Thank you, Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the fax 210,000 dead people in our country. In just the last several months, over seven million people who have contracted this disease one in five businesses closed. We're looking at front line workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We're looking at over 30 million people who in the last several months had to file for unemployment. And here's the thing. On January 28th, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it's lethal and consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people and that it would be contracted because it is airborne and they knew what was happening and they didn't tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28th, as opposed to March 13th? What they knew, what you might have done to prepare? They knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimize the seriousness of it. The president said. You're on one side of his ledger. If you wear a mask, you're on the other side of his ledger if you don't. And in spite of all of that today, they still don't have a plan. They still don't have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does, and our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy. Contact tracing for testing for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on and we need to save our country and Joe Biden is the best leader to do that. And frankly, this administration has forfeited.</p>
<h3>[5:43] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you. So</p>
<h3>[5:44] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>they're right to reelection based on this.</p>
<h3>[5:46] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you. Senator Harris, Vice President Pence. More than 210,000 Americans have died of Covert 19 since February. The U. S. Death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on earth, for instance, our death rate is 2.5 times that of Canada. Next door, you had the administration's coronavirus task force. Why is the U. S death toll as a percentage of our population higher than that of almost every other wealthy country? And you have two minutes to respond without interruption.</p>
<h3>[6:21] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Susan, thank you. And I want to thank the commission in the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, privileged to be on the stage with you in our nation, has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know from the very first day President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. That was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now Senator Joe Biden Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House coronavirus task forces, that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War two. And I believe it saved hundreds of thousands of American lives because with that time, we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies, so our doctors and nurses had The resource is support they needed. And we began really, before the month of February was art to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics had been saving lives all along the way. Under President Trump's leadership operation warp speed, we believe we'll have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing, testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, um, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first in the American people. I believe with my heart can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It saved calculus, American lives.</p>
<h3>[8:34] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Senator Harris, would you like to respond?</p>
<h3>[8:36] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Absolutely. Whatever the vice president is claiming the administration has done clearly it hasn't worked. When you're looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss and you know the vice president is the head of the task force and new on January 28 how serious this was. And then, thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it, and then when that was exposed the vice president said when asked. Well, why don't you all tell anybody? He said, because the president wanted people to remain calm. Well, let's go ahead. But But, Susan, this is important. And I want to add Mr Vice President speaking.</p>
<h3>[9:23] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>I'm speaking,</p>
<h3>[9:25] Susan Page</h3>
<p>you know, 15 more seconds, and then we'll give the vice president. So</p>
<h3>[9:28] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I wanna ask the American people, How come are you when you were panicked about where you're gonna get your next roll of toilet paper? How come were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn't know when they could go back? How come to you when your Children couldn't see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them?</p>
<h3>[9:46] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Let's give Vice President Pence a chance to respond. Vice president, you have one minute to reach.</p>
<h3>[9:49] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>You know, there's not a day gone by that I haven't thought of every American family that's lost a loved one, and I want all of you to know that you'll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say with the American people have done over these last eight months hasn't worked. That's a great disservice the sacrifices the American people have made the reality. If I may, if I may finish that the reality is Dr Fauci said, everything that he told the president in the Oval Office, the president told the American people, Now, President Trump, I will tell you, has boundless confidence in the American people and he always spoke with confidence that we'd get through this together. But when you say it hasn't worked, When Dr Fauci and Dr Burke's and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said if the president didn't take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy that we could lose 2.2 million Americans, that's the reality. They also said to us if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans. One life lost is too many Susan. But the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family in their neighbors. First, our doctors, our nurses, our first</p>
<h3>[11:07] Susan Page</h3>
<p>thank you Vice President Pence</p>
<h3>[11:08] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>and I'm going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done,</p>
<h3>[11:11] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Vice President Pence. You were in the front row in a Rose Garden event 11 days ago. What seems to have been a super spreader event for senior administration and congressional officials? No social distancing, few mask and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration's safety guidelines to protect themselves from co vid when you at the White House have not been doing so</p>
<h3>[11:37] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>well? The American people have demonstrated over the last eight months they were given the fax. They're willing to put the health of their families and their neighbors and people they don't even know. First, President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people, and, uh, and their ability to take that information and put it into practice in the height of the epidemic, when we were losing heartbreaking number of 2500 Americans a day, we surge Resource is to New Jersey and New York and New Orleans and Detroit, we told the American people would needed to be done, and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sun Belt happened this summer, again. Americans step forward. But the reality is the work of the president of the United States goes on. Vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us, and the president introduced Judge Amy Coney. Barrett.</p>
<h3>[12:31] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you. Thank you at that.</p>
<h3>[12:33] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>If I may say that Rose Garden event, if a great deal of speculation about it, my wife, Karen, and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus. And it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advised. The difference here is President Trump, and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates and not not just mandates with the coronavirus but a government takeover of health. Thank you, thank you. Green New deal. All government control were about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people.</p>
<h3>[13:14] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Let's talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader. Speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear, but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker, knowing you didn't have enough money saved up. And now you're standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let's talk about caring about the American people. The American people have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the</p>
<h3>[13:59] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>people that we</p>
<h3>[13:59] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>talked that was asking too much of the people look, they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and</p>
<h3>[14:09] Susan Page</h3>
<p>their Children. Kamala Harris, Senator Harris. I mean, I'm sorry.</p>
<h3>[14:12] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>That's fine. I'm comin.</p>
<h3>[14:13] Susan Page</h3>
<p>No, no. Your Senator Harris to me, um, for life to get back to normal. Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated. But half of Americans now say they wouldn't take a vaccine if it was released. Now, if the Trump Administration approves the vaccine before or after the election, should Americans take it? And would you take it</p>
<h3>[14:37] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>if the public health professionals if Dr Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I'll be the first in line to take it? Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us I should say that we should take it, I'm not taking it.</p>
<h3>[14:50] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Vice President Pence There have been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic in recent days. The president's diagnosis of Covert 19 has underscored the importance of the job that you hold and that you are seeking. That's our second topic tonight. It's the role of the vice president. One of you will make history. On January 20th, you will be the vice president to the oldest president the United States has ever had. Donald Trump will be 74 years old on Inauguration Day. Joe Biden will be 78 years old. That already has raised concerns among some voters concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump's hospitalization in recent days. Vice President Pence, Have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability. And if not, do you think you should? You have two minutes without interruption.</p>
<h3>[15:46] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Well, Susan, thank you. Although I would like to go back todo move on. Well, thank you, but I would like to go back because the reality is that we're going to have a vaccine, senator in record time, an unheard of time. In less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials, and we're right now producing tens of millions of doses. So the fact that you continue toe undermine public confidence in the vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is is unconscionable. And, Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with people's lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine we believe before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in the vaccine is just It's just unacceptable. Let me also say, you know, the reality is when you talk about about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2000 and nine. The swine flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was ended up not being is lethal as the coronavirus before the end of the year when Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, not 7.5 million people contract ID to swine flu. 60 million Americans contract with the swine flu. If the swine flu had been his lethal is the coronavirus. In 2000 and nine, when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost two million American lives. His own chief of staff, Ron claimed, would say last year that it was pure luck that they did quote everything possible wrong. And we learned from that they lived the strategic national stockpile empty. They left a new empty and hollow plan. But we still learn from it. And</p>
<h3>[17:49] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I think the American people I'm gonna</p>
<h3>[17:51] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>see again could be</p>
<h3>[17:52] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Vice President Pence. I'm sorry,</p>
<h3>[17:53] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>what we have done. And, Senator, please</p>
<h3>[17:55] Susan Page</h3>
<p>thank you. Stop</p>
<h3>[17:56] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>undermining confidence in the vaccine.</p>
<h3>[17:58] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Senator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked Vice President Pence, which is Have you had a conversation are reached an agreement with Vice President Biden about safeguards, our procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability and if not, and if you win the election next month, do you think you should? You have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[18:19] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>So let me tell you. First of all, um, the day I got the call from from Joe Biden, it was actually a zoom call. Um, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable memorable days of my life. I, you know, I thought about my mother who came to the United States at the age of 19 gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California, and the thought that I'd be sitting here right now I know would make her proud. And she must be looking down on this. Um, you know, Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service, and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because, you know, I have a career that included being elected the first woman district attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for for law enforcement in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected, um, the first, uh, woman of color and black woman to be elected attorney general of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. And there I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners to for profit colleges that we're taking advantage of veterans. And then, of course, now I serve in the United States. Senate is only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where I've been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. I've traveled the world. I've met with our soldiers in our in war zones, and I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share we share a purpose which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump unifying our country around our common values and principles.</p>
<h3>[20:24] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Senator Harris. You know, neither neither President Trump nor vice President Biden has released a sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election. And in recent days, President Trump's doctors have given misleading answers or refused to answer basic questions about his health. And my question to each of you in turn, is Is this information voters deserve to know. Vice President Pence. Would you like to go</p>
<h3>[20:51] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>first? Well, Susan, thank you. And, uh and let me, let me say, on behalf of the President and the first Lady, how move we've all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern and for the President. And I do believe it's emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the coronavirus. But the care of the president received at Walter Reed Hospital, the White House doctors was exceptional, and the transparency that they practiced all along the way will continue. The American people have a right to know about the health and well being of their president and will continue to do that. But I'm just extremely grateful and was more than more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And, Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions. Genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, uh, as I did on that phone call on the historic nature of your nomination. Um, I never expected to be on this stage four years ago, so I know the feeling. But the reality is, um, we've got an election before the American people in the midst of this challenging year, and the stakes have never been higher. Thank you. The choice has never been so.</p>
<h3>[22:13] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I wanna give Senator. Here is a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates, and especially about presidents, especially when they're facing some kind of challenge?</p>
<h3>[22:27] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Absolutely. And that's why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly, by contrast, the president has not both in terms of health records, but also let's look at taxes we now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said, You mean $750,000 and it was like No, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear when when we say in debt, it means you owe money to somebody. And it be really good to know who the president of the United States, the commander in chief owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president's decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people of you or self interest? So, Susan, I'm glad you asked about transparency because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He is honest. He is forthright. But Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been about covering up everything.</p>
<h3>[23:48] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thanks. Thank you, Senator. here, so I want to give you a chance to respond. Vice President.</p>
<h3>[23:51] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Well, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public services. Well, thank you, but the American people have a president. He was a businessman. It's a job creator who's paid tens of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He's created tens of thousands of American jobs, The president said those public reports air not accurate. The president also released literally stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review, just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago. Thank you. Turn this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulation.</p>
<h3>[24:41] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Thank</p>
<h3>[24:42] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>you. Energy fighting for free and fair trade. And all</p>
<h3>[24:46] Susan Page</h3>
<p>of us. Thank</p>
<h3>[24:46] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>you. Vice President Joe Biden and Common. You</p>
<h3>[24:49] Susan Page</h3>
<p>know, that's a good segue into our third topic, which is about the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans. It's been so affected by this coronavirus we have a jobs crisis brewing. On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to 7.9% in September. But the job growth has stalled, and that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry. At Disney and elsewhere, hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking for work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year haven't been replaced. Those hardest hit include Latinos, blacks and women. Senator Harris, The Biden Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy. And you would pay for that new spending by raising $4 trillion in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes? Put the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer uninterrupted?</p>
<h3>[25:54] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Thank you, Um, on the issue of the economy, I think there couldn't be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America's economy based on the health and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing, which is why he passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people and I have to pay for. On Day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He'll get rid of it and what he'll do with the money is invested in the American people and through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week. I don't think it ever happened, but Joe Biden will do that. He'll invest in infrastructure. It's about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe was gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were in an innovation leader on the Globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So, for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College. It will be free if you come from a family that makes less than $125,000. You'll go to a public university for free and across the board will make sure that if you have student loan debt, it's cut by $10,000. That's how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it's about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business.</p>
<h3>[27:50] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Senator Harris, Vice president Pence. Your administration has been predicting a rapid in robust recovery, but the latest economic report suggests that's not happening. Should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months, but a year? Or Mawr? You have two minutes to answer uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[28:09] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>When President Trump and I took office America gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression, when Joe Biden was vice president, they tried to tax and spend and regulate and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes across the board despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2000 in savings in taxes. And with the rising wages that occurred most predominantly for blue collar, hard working Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4000 following President Trump's tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you on day one, Joe Biden is going to raise your taxes. It's really remarkable to think e right after a time where we're going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we've already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, roll back regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade and secured $4 trillion from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families save 50 million jobs through the paycheck protection program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people in the American worker. Through this, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They wanna bury our economy under a $2 trillion green New deal, which you were one of the original co sponsors of in the United States Senate they want to abolish fossil fuels and banned fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the Heartland. And Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect of fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracy is on the ballot. Make no mistake about it, Susan. The American economy. The American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity. Four more years of President Donald Trump, 2021 Thank you. Very biggest economic year in the history of this country.</p>
<h3>[30:20] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris.</p>
<h3>[30:23] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Well, I mean that we saw enough of it in last week's debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth and the truth. And the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear. He will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year appeal. The Trump tax cut. Mr Vice president speaking well, I'm speaking</p>
<h3>[30:41] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>the important. As you said the truth. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that he's going to repeal the Trump tax cuts that was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2000 in a tax break. Every single</p>
<h3>[30:55] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>senator, that is absolutely not true. That</p>
<h3>[30:59] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>is the only cutting. Is he only going to repeal part of the Trump tax cuts?</p>
<h3>[31:02] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>If you don't mind letting me finish, we can then have a conversation. OK, please. OK, Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who, during the great recession, was responsible for the recovery act that brought America back. And now the trump hence administration wants to take credit when they rant. When they rode the coattails of Joe Biden success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term, Of course, now the economy is a complete disaster. But Joe Biden, on the one hand, did that on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to over 20 million Americans and protected people with preexisting conditions and what it also did. Is it saved to those families who otherwise we're going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford? On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who's in court right now, trying to get rid of trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections if you have pre existing conditions. And I just This is very important, Susan, and</p>

<h3>[32:57] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Well, I hope we have a chance to talk about health care because obamacare was a disaster. The American people remember it well. President Trump and I have a plan to improve health care and protect pre existing conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your own opinion, but you're not entitled to your own fax. You yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked a supporter in the eye and pointed and said, I guarantee I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels. They have a $2 trillion version of the green New Deal. Susan, that your newspaper use a today said it really wasn't that very different from the original green New Deal. Mawr Taxes, Mawr Regulation Banning fracking, Abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing the V shaped recovery that's underway right now, we'll continue with four more years of President Donald Trump.</p>
<h3>[34:05] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you very, very much. Vice President Pence once again, you provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change and Vice President Pence. I'd like to pose the first question to you this year. We've seen record setting hurricanes in the South. Another one Hurricane Delta is now threatening the gulf, and we have seen record setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe, as the scientific community has concluded, that man made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and more deadly and have made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[34:42] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Thank you, Susan. Well, first, I'm very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According Toa. All of the best estimates are our air and land are cleaner than anytime ever recorded. Our water is among the cleanest in the world. And just a little while ago, the president signed the outdoors acts with largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years, so President Trump has made a commitment to conservation into the environment. Now, with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is what's the cause on? What do we do about it? President Trump has made it clear that we're going to continue to listen to the science now. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris would put us back in the Paris climate accord. They'd impose the green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy costs of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy, you know, what's remarkable is the United States has reduced CO two Mawr than the country's. They're still in the Paris climate accord, but we've done it through innovation, and we've done it through natural gas and fracking, which Senator the American people can go. Look at the record I and oh, Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do. But the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking. And so by creating the kind of American innovation we're actually steering toward a stronger and better environment with regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center, and even Governor Gavin Newsom from your state has agreed. We've gotta work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually is difficult as they are. There are no MAWR hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago, but many of the climate alarmist, abused hurricanes and wildfires to try and</p>
<h3>[36:56] Susan Page</h3>
<p>sell that</p>
<h3>[36:57] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>bill of goods of a green New deal. And President Trump and I are gonna always put American jobs for American workers. First</p>
<h3>[37:04] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Senator Harris, as the vice president mentioned you, co sponsored the green New Deal in Congress. But Vice President Biden said in last week's debate that he does not support the green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden Harris campaign website, it describes the green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden Harris administration toward the green New deal? You have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[37:29] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Sure so, first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden's economic plan, Moody's, which is a reputable Wall Street firm, has said, will create seven million more jobs than Donald Trump's. And part of those jobs that will be created by Joe Biden are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see Joe understands that the West coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes again in science. I'll tell you something, Susan. I served when I first got to the Senate on the committee that's responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website and then took the phrase climate change off the website? This we have seen a pattern with this administration, which is they don't believe in science, and Joe's plan is about saying we're going to deal with it, but we're also gonna create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and And the question was, you know, the science is telling us that you know what Donald Trump said. Science doesn't know. So let's talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existentialist threat. Tow us as human beings. Joe is about saying, We're going to invest that in renewable energy. What's going to be about the creation of millions of jobs we will achieve. Net zero emissions by 2050. Carbon neutral by 2035. Joe has a plan. This has been allowed to talk from the Trump administration, and really, it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also re enter the climate agreement with pride.</p>
<h3>[39:43] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Senator Harris just said that climate change is an existentially threat. Vice President Pence. Do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat?</p>
<h3>[39:54] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>As I said, Susan, the climate is changing will follow the science. But once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they're going to raise taxes on every American, Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week but on Day one, he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. With regard to banning Fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban Fracking. You were the first Senate co sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the green new deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out the green New Deal is on their campaign website and is use A today said It's essentially the same plan as you co sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate, and you just heard the senator say that she's gonna resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the the American people have always cherished our environment will continue to cherish it. We've made great progress reducing CO two emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking. We don't need a massive $2 trillion green new deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American families. Joe Biden wants</p>
<h3>[41:16] Susan Page</h3>
<p>us to</p>
<h3>[41:16] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>retrofit four million business buildings. It makes no sense it will cost jobs. President Trump. Thank you, America. First he's gonna put jobs first, and we're gonna take care of our environment and follow the science.</p>
<h3>[41:30] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>You know, on the issue of jobs.</p>
<h3>[41:32] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Senator, here,</p>
<h3>[41:32] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>let's talk about that. You, the the vice president earlier referred Thio as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment. Um, the president's trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is because of a so called trade war with China. America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession because of it. And when we look at where this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration. And the American people know what I'm talking about. You know, I think about 20 year olds. You know, we have a 20 year old 20 something year old who are coming out of high school and college right now, and you're wondering is there gonna be a job there for me? We're looking at people who are trying to figure out how they're going to pay rent by the end of the month. Almost half of American renters are worried about whether they're going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now, and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration.</p>
<h3>[42:58] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Senator Harris, Vice president Pence. Let me give just 15 seconds to respond, because then I want to move on</p>
<h3>[43:03] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>to Well, I love to respond. Look Lost the trade war with China. Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for Communist China through over the last several decades, and again, Senator Harris, you're entitled to your opinion. You're not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs, and President Obama said they were never coming back. He said we needed a magic wand to bring him back. In our first three years after we cut taxes, roll back regulation unleashed American energy. This administration saw 500,000 jobs created, and that's exactly the kind of growth we're going to continue to see is we bring our nation through this pandemic Green New deal. Massive new mandate. Your Paris climate accord. It's gonna kill jobs this time, just like it killed jobs.</p>
<h3>[43:53] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I just need to respond. Very 50 seconds. Thank you. Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America's auto industry, and you voted against it. So let's set the record straight. Thank you.</p>
<h3>[44:08] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I'd like to talk about China. We have as our next topic. We have no more complicated are consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. It's a potential partner in dealing with climate change in North Korea. And in a video tonight, President Trump again blamed it for the coronavirus, saying China will pay Vice President Pence. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors, adversaries, enemies? You have two minutes.</p>
<h3>[44:42] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Thank you, Susan. Well, let me before I leave that Let me let me speak toe voting records if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA cost literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go south of the border. President Trump fought to re negotiate NAFTA and the United States Mexico Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know. Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the U. S. M. C. A. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But Senator you, you said it didn't go far enough on climate change that that you put your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers in ahead of American jobs, and the American people deserve to know. That is probably why Newsweek magazine said that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019 more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So now, with regard to China there, Susan first and foremost China is to blame for the coronavirus, and President Trump is not happy about it. He's made that very clear, made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump in dealing with China from the outset of this administration, standing up to China that have been taking advantage of America for decades In the wake of Joe Biden's cheerleading for China. President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know. Joe Biden opposed President Trump's decision to suspend all travel from China. He said it was hysterical, he said.</p>
<h3>[46:45] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you very phobic. President Trump, President</p>
<h3>[46:48] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>of China. We're going to continue to stand strong.</p>
<h3>[46:50] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Vice President. We want</p>
<h3>[46:52] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>to improve the relationship, but we're gonna level the playing field, and we're gonna hold China accountable for what they did to America with the coronavirus.</p>
<h3>[46:58] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Senator. Here. Somebody ask you the same question that I asked the vice president. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Are we competitors, adversaries, enemies? We'll have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[47:14] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Susan The Trump Administrations perspective and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs and America's standing. There's a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created within the White House in office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got away, they got rid of it. Not true. There was a team of disease experts that President Obama and vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pull them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let's look at the job situation we mentioned before the trade deal. The trade war. They wanted to call it with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs and a manufacturing recession and the American consumer paying thousands of dollars more for goods because of that failed war that they called it. Then let's talk about standing. Pew of reputable research firm has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect G. Ping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party. Then they do Donald Trump, the president of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today because of a failure of leadership by this administration.</p>
<h3>[49:18] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Senator Harris. We've seen changes in the role of the United States in terms of global leadership over the past four years. And, of course, times do change. What's your definition? We've seen strange with China. Of course, as the vice president mentioned, we've seen strange with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?</p>
<h3>[49:43] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>So, you know, Joe is e love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues, and you know, Joe E think he said it quite well. He says, You know, foreign policy. It might sound complicated, but really it's relationships. They're just think about it, his relationships. And so we know this In our personal professional relationships, you gotta keep your word to your friends. God be loyal to your friends. People who have stood with you got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and and between and embraced dictators around the world. Let's take, for example, Russia. So Rush I serve on the intelligence Committee of the United States Senate, America's intelligence community told us. Russia interfered in the election of the president, United States in 2016 and is playing in 2020. Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, said the same. But Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America, prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. You look at our friends at NATO, he has walked away from agreements. You can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal, guys. We were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends with allies around the country, and because of Donald Trump's unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan, it's about relationships and the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation. In addition to our great military has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesn't understand that because he doesn't understand what it means to be honest.</p>
<h3>[51:48] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Senator Harris, Vice President Pence. Let me give you a chance to respond.</p>
<h3>[51:53] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Well, thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, capital of the state of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that, and they never did. We stood strong with our allies, but we've been demanding. NATO is now contributing mawr to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trump's leadership, we've strengthened our alliances across the Asia Pacific and we've stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know, when President Trump came into office, Isis had captured an area of the Middle East the size of Pennsylvania of President Trump, unleash the American military and our armed forces, destroyed the Isis Caliphate and took out their leader al Baghdadi. Without one American casualty, al Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands. Um but notably America's hearts today, or with the family of Kayla Mueller, your parents, which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the Isis killers responsible for Kayla Mueller's murder were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield along with the other Beetle. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla. Mueller breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office, presented a plan. The said they knew where Kayla Waas Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused or mercilessly, before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month, and when armed forces finally went in, it was clear she had been moved two days earlier and her family says with heart that broke the heart of every American that if President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today.</p>

<p>thank you, Vice President,</p>
<h3>[54:23] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Take action.</p>
<h3>[54:24] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great lengths. Because, of course, there other topics we want to talk about</p>
<h3>[54:30] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I would like equal time.</p>
<h3>[54:31] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Yes, Please, go ahead.</p>
<h3>[54:34] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>First of all, to the Mueller family. I know about your daughter's case, and I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Um, what happened to her is awful, and it should have never happened. And I know Joe feels the same way, and I know that President Obama feels the same way. Um, but you mentioned Soleimani. Let's let's start there. So after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq and they suffered serious brain injuries. And do you know what? Donald Trump dismissed them as headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump's where he has referred Thio, our men who are serving in our military as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went toe Arlington Cemetery and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said What's in it for them? Because, of course, you know, he only thinks about what's in it for him. Let's take what he said about John McCain, a great American hero. And Donald Trump says he doesn't deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war. Take And this is This is very important when you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief and what they care about and what they don't care about public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers. And you know what a bounty is. It's somebody puts a price on your head and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladimir Putin and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that, Joe Biden would. But but Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat, tow our nation's security or tow our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our say.</p>
<h3>[56:52] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Senator Harris. This is such an important issue. But we have other important issues as well. And I wanna I wanna make sure we have a chance</p>
<h3>[56:58] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>to talk about. Look, she has</p>
<h3>[57:01] Susan Page</h3>
<p>15 seconds because</p>
<h3>[57:02] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>I gotta trying to get that. Look,</p>
<h3>[57:03] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I'm sorry, but Vice President had more time than she said, so. Finders</p>
<h3>[57:08] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd.</p>
<h3>[57:14] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I'm sorry. My son is a</p>
<h3>[57:16] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>captain in the United States Marine Corps. My son in law is deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military. President Donald Trump not only respects but reveres all of those who serve in our armed forces in any suggestion. Otherwise it's ridiculous.</p>
<h3>[57:34] Susan Page</h3>
<p>E didn't know Vice President. Since I did not excuse me, E did not create the rules for tonight. Your campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight's debate with the Commission on President debates. I'm here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another, giving roughly equal time to both of you. which is what I'm trying very hard to</p>
<h3>[57:58] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>be. Oh,</p>
<h3>[57:58] Susan Page</h3>
<p>so I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is a new important one, as the last topic was. And that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrettes Nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator Harris, you'll be there is a member of the committee. Her confirmation would cement the court's conservative majority and make it likely open tomb or abortion restrictions, even toe overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the states. Vice President Pence. You're the former governor of Indiana. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[58:45] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Well, thank you for the question, but I'll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before the American people deserve to know. Qasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American service members. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad, killed more Americans. President Trump didn't hesitate, and Qasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Camilla Harris actually criticized the decision to take out solemn Kassam Soleimani. It's really inexplicable. But with regard to Joe Biden, it's It's explainable because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It's absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American service members. And that's what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States, let me say President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. And she's a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizeable American family, the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is in the hearing next week. Unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others, we hope she gets a fair hearing, and we particularly hope that we don't see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before I mean, the Democrat chairman of the Judiciary Committee, before when when Judge Bear was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals expressed concern that the dogma of her faith lived loudly in her. Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Uh, Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees you actually attacked because they remember the Catholic Knights of Columbus just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro life views. And</p>
<h3>[60:47] Susan Page</h3>
<p>thank you. Thank you, Vice President, Your time</p>
<h3>[60:49] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>is when the hearing takes place that</p>
<h3>[60:51] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Vice President Pence,</p>
<h3>[60:52] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected.</p>
<h3>[60:55] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank</p>
<h3>[60:55] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>you. Vice President voted and confirmed the Supreme Court of the United</p>
<h3>[60:58] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Senator Harris. You're the senator from and former attorney general of California. So let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the vice president. If Roe v. Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion and you have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[61:18] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith, and it's insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith. And in fact, Joe, if elected, will be on Lee, the second practicing Catholic A za president of the United States. On the issue of this of this nomination don't I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States and you know, before when this conversation has come up, you know, it's been about election year or election time. We're literally in an election. Over four million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now, and so Joe has been very clear. As the American people are, let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we'll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court and to your point Susan, the issues before us couldn't be more serious. There is the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman's right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump and the vice president, Michael Pence. But let's also look at what else is before the the court. It's the affordable care act, like literally in the midst of a public health pandemic, when over 210,000 people have died and seven million people probably have what will be in the future, considered a pre existing condition because you contracted the virus. Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and I said it before and it bears repeating. This means that there will be no more protections if they win. For people with preexisting conditions, this means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you're under the age of 26 you can't stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here's the thing. The contrast couldn't be more clear. They're trying to get rid of the affordable care act Joe Biden is saying. Let's expand coverage. Let's give you a choice of a public option or private coverage. Let's bring down premiums. Let's lower Medicare eligibility to 60. Thank you. That's true leadership.</p>
<h3>[63:41] Susan Page</h3>
<p>You know, you mentioned earlier Vice President Pence that the president was committed to maintaining protections for people with preexisting conditions. Um, and but you do have this court case that you are supporting your administration supporting that would strike down the Affordable Care Act, the president says. President Trump says that he's going to protect people with preexisting conditions, but he has not explained how he would do that. And that was one of the toughest nuts to crack when they were passing the Affordable Care Act. So tell us specifically, How would your administration protect Americans with pre existing conditions? Have access to affordable insurance if the affordable care act is struck down.</p>
<h3>[64:23] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Well, thank you, Susan, but let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn't be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I'm pro life. I don't apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there's such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth late term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now, For our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States. But we'll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer. Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden going to pack the court? If Joe Jamie Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, they've been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases, but your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years. If you don't get your way, this is a classic case of If you can't win by the rules, you're going to change the rules. Now you've refused to answer the question. Joe Biden has refused to answer the question, so I think the American people would really like to know if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Are you and Joe Biden If somehow you win this election going toe, pack the Supreme Court to get your way?</p>
<h3>[65:59] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I'm so glad we went through a little history lesson. Let's do that a little more in 18. 60.</p>
<h3>[66:06] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>I'd like you to answer the</p>
<h3>[66:07] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>question. Vice President speaking. I'm speaking okay in 18 64 1 of the I think political heroes. Certainly the president. I assume if you also Mr Vice President is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for re election, and it was 27 days before the election and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln's party was in charge not only of the White House but the Senate, but honest Abe said, Not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land. And so Joe and I are very clear the American people are voting right now, and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime.</p>
<h3>[67:10] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Senator Harris.</p>
<h3>[67:12] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Well, Susan are voting right now. They'd like to know if you and Joe Biden are gonna pack the Supreme court. If you don't get your way in this nomination,</p>
<h3>[67:20] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>let's talk about</p>
<h3>[67:22] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>once you gave a non answer. Joe Biden gave</p>
<h3>[67:24] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>a non answer. The American</p>
<h3>[67:26] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>people deserve a straight answer. And if you haven't figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. Men and women, I gotta tell you, people across this country, if you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden Harris ticket. Come November, the third reelect president Donald Trump, will stand by that separation powers in a nine seat Supreme</p>
<h3>[67:50] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Court. Let's talk about packing the court. Then let's talk about the fact. Yeah, I'm about to. So the Trump Pence administration has been because I sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Susan, as you mentioned, and I have witnessed the appointments for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, courts of appeal, people who are purely ideological people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found to have been not competent are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals for Lifetime appointments. Not one is black. This is what they've been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let's have that discussion.</p>
<h3>[68:40] Susan Page</h3>
<p>All right. Thank you. Thank you, Senator. Let's go on and talk about the issue of racial. Just</p>
<h3>[68:46] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>I just want the record. Reflect. She never answered the question. So the American people, maybe the next debate, Joe Biden, will answer the question. But I think the American people know the answer.</p>
<h3>[68:53] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Vice President. In March, Briana Taylor, a 26 year old emergency room technician in Louisville, was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant in on a narcotics investigation broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylor's boyfriend said he didn't hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Rianna Taylor, was justice done. You have two minutes.</p>
<h3>[69:34] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I don't believe so, and I've I've talked with Brianna's mother to make a Palmer and her family, and her family deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an e m. T to first learn what's going on out on the street so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life has taken unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed during which American man was tortured and killed under the knee oven, armed, uniformed police officer and people around our country of every race of every age of every gender, perfect strangers to each other marched shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests, and I believe strongly that first of all, we're never going toe condone violence. But we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the fight to achieve our ideals. And that's why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject look and I'm a former career prosecutor. I know what I'm talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform off our policing in America and our criminal justice system, Which is why Joe and I will immediately banned chokeholds and karate holes. George Floyd would be alive today. If we did that, we will require a national registry for police officers who break the law. We will, on the issue of criminal justice reform, get rid of private prisons and cash bail, and we will decriminalize marijuana and we will weigh will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana. This</p>
<h3>[71:45] Susan Page</h3>
<p>is a time</p>
<h3>[71:46] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>for leadership on a tragic, tragic issue. Unarmed black people in America.</p>
<h3>[71:51] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Who? Vice President Pence. Let me pose the same question to you. In the case of your own, a tailor was justice done. You have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[72:05] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Well, our heart breaks for the loss of indecent any innocents, American life on the family. Briana Taylor has our sympathies, but I trust our justice system. A grand jury that refused the evidence and it really is remarkable that as a former prosecutor you would assume that an impaneled grand jury looking at all the evidence got it wrong. But you're entitled to your opinion, Senator. I think what? And with regard toe George Floyd, there's no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served, but there's also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon was burned to the ground by rioters and looters, and Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must tell you this this this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that that America's systemically racist, that is Joe Biden said that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day. President Trump and I stand with you, and it is remarkable that that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats. Senator Harris. You got up and walked out of the room, and then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott's bill on the Senate floor That would have provided new accountability. New repeat resource is, but we don't have to choose between supporting law enforcement, proving public safety and supporting our African American neighbors and all of our minorities under President Trump's leadership always stand with law enforcement, and we'll do what we've just president. Thank you. Your time is the lives of African Americans.</p>
<h3>[74:21] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you. Record</p>
<h3>[74:22] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>unemployment, record investments in education and fight for school choice for all of our thank you.</p>
<h3>[74:28] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I'd like to respond.</p>
<h3>[74:29] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Senator Harris.</p>
<h3>[74:30] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I will not sit here and be lectured by the vice president on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. I am the only one on this state who was personally prosecuted. Everything from child sexual assaults or homicide. I'm the only one on this stage was prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of America's homeowners. I'm the only one on this stage who prosecuted for profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans. And the reality of this is that we're talking about an election in 27 days, where last week the president of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists. Not and not true. It wasn't like he didn't have a chance. He didn't do it, and then he doubled down. And then he said, when pressed, Stand back, stand by. And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump's. He was. He called Mexicans, rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act, a Muslim ban. He on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protest ing the need for racial justice where a young woman was killed. And on the other side there were neo Nazis carrying tiki torches, shouting racial epithets but anti Semitic slurs. And Donald Trump, when asked about it, said there were fine people on both sides. This is who we have is the president of the United States and America. You deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together and recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us</p>
<h3>[76:27] Susan Page</h3>
<p>vice president, Pence. Let me give you a minute to respond.</p>
<h3>[76:30] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Thank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. You know, I think this one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country, Susan, is that you selectively edit. Just like Senator Harris did comments that President Trump and I and others on our side of the atomic, I mean, Senator Harris conveniently omitted after after the president made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the cake neo Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly your concern that he doesn't condemn neo Nazis. President Trump has Jewish grandchildren, his daughter and son in large Jewish. This is a president who who respects and cherishes all of the American people. But you talk about having personally prosecuted. I'm glad you brought up your record, Senator.</p>
<h3>[77:22] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<h3>[77:23] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>I really need to make this point. When you were when you were d A in San Francisco, when you left office, African Americans were 19 times mawr likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the purport, the disproportionate incarceration of blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn't lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. I mean, the reality is your record speaks for itself. President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice for</p>
<h3>[78:00] Susan Page</h3>
<p>thank you. Vice President fought for</p>
<h3>[78:01] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>educational choice and opportunities for African Americans. All of our</p>
<h3>[78:04] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, sir.</p>
<h3>[78:05] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>And we'll do it for for</p>
<h3>[78:06] Susan Page</h3>
<p>thank you. You know, there is no more important issue than the final issue that we're going to talk about tonight, and that is the issue of the election. But itself.</p>
<h3>[78:14] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>He attacked my record. I would like an opportunity to respond.</p>
<h3>[78:17] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Let me give you 30 seconds, because because we're running out of</p>
<h3>[78:20] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>time. I appreciate that. First of all, having served as the attorney general of the state of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do, and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on chokeholds and created holes. Thank you. Not only</p>
<h3>[78:48] Susan Page</h3>
<p>thank you. Said</p>
<h3>[78:49] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I would like to go through</p>
<h3>[78:50] Susan Page</h3>
<p>these air points that you made earlier in the hour. And I want to talk about the election itself before we have to.</p>
<h3>[78:54] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>But I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do. And my record, which includes I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias. Because, yes, Joe Biden and I recognize that implicit bias does exist. Mr. Vice President, Contrary to what you may believe, we did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in re entry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward and again. I will not be lectured by the Vice President on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our communities safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America.</p>
<h3>[79:44] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Senator Harrison. I'd like to oppose the first, I'd like you to respond first to the question on our final topic. The election itself. President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and Vice President Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes.</p>
<h3>[80:13] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>So I'll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition that we've built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalitions of folks that you've ever seen in a presidential race. Of course, we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans. In fact, um, seven members of President George W. Bush's Cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich. Over 500 generals, retired generals and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign, and I believe they're doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy and to fight for the integrity of our democracy and to bring integrity back to the White House. And so we believe in the American people. We believe in our democracy. And here's what I'd like to say to everybody. Vote, please vote. Vote early. Come up with a plan to vote. Go toe. I will vote dot com. You can also go toe joe biden dot com. We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years, and it is within our power. And if we use our vote and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy with what Donald Trump has been doing, as he did on the debate stage last week when again in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage because clearly Donald Trump doesn't think he can run on a record because it's a failed record. Joe Biden. None that stage said, Hey, just please vote. So I'll repeat with Joe said Please vote.</p>
<h3>[82:13] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Senator Vice President Pence President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If vice President Biden has declared the winner and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as vice president? What would you personally do? You have two minutes.</p>
<h3>[82:36] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Well, Susan, first and foremost, I think we're gonna win this election. Because while Joe Biden, Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany of the establishment in Washington, D. C. And establishment that Joe Biden's been a part of for 47 years, President Donald Trump is has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016 they see this president's record where we rebuild our military. We revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level, and and we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day. And I think I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years, when you talk about accepting the outcome of the election? Um, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last 3.5 years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It's amazing when Joe Biden is vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump in my campaign. I mean, there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign. And of course, we've all seen the Avalanche. What what you put the country through for for the better part of three years until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the in the Congress trying to impeach the president of the United States over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton is actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede the election. So let me just say I think we're gonna win this election, President Trump and are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail in voting that will create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election. We know we're gonna have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump's gonna be re elected for four more years.</p>
<h3>[84:49] Susan Page</h3>
<p>You know, I've I've asked I've written all the questions that I've asked tonight. But for the final question of the debate, ID like Teoh, right? Read a question that someone else wrote. The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask you, and I want to close tonight's debate with the question posed by Brooklyn Brown. She's an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah. And here's what she wrote quote. When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watched the news, all I see are two candidates from opposing parties trying to tear each other down. If our leaders can't get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along and then she added, Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together. End quote. So each of you, in turn, I'd like you to take one minute and respond. Brooklyn Vice President Pence. You have one minute,</p>
<h3>[85:54] Mike Pence</h3>
<p>Brooklyn. It's a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for taking an interest in public life. I I started following the news when I was very young, and in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate on. We celebrate that. It's how we've created literally the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. I would tell you that don't assume that what you're seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I looked at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court in the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites on the Supreme Court of the United States, one very liberal, one very conservative. But what's been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families with very closest of friends. I mean, here in America, we can disagree. We can debate vigorously. A Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. That's what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country. So I just want to encourage you. Brooklyn, I want to tell you that, um, we're gonna work every day to have government as good as our people. The American people each and every day love a good debate. We love a good argument, but we always come together and are always there for one another in times of need. And we've especially learned that thank you for the difficulties of this year.</p>
<h3>[87:35] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Senator Harris. What would you say to Brooklyn?</p>
<h3>[87:39] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Um, first of all, I'm I'd love hearing from our young leaders. And when I hear her words when I hear your words Brooklyn, um, I know our future is bright because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be. Um, that is a sign of leadership. And it's something we should all aspire to be on DNA that, you know, that brings me to Joe Joe Biden. One of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier. Um, it's so troubled him and upset him like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. Um, what propelled Joe to run for president was to see that over the course of the last four years, what Brooklyn described has been happening. Joe has a long standing reputation of working across the aisle. They're working in a bipartisan way on. That's what he's going to do, is President Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You mean you have to know Joe's story to know that Joe has known pain. He is known suffering, and he has known love and so Brooklyn. When you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright and it will be because of your leadership. And it will be because we fight for each person's voice through their vote, and we get engaged in this election because you have the ability through your work and through eventually your vote to determine the future of our country and what its leadership looks like.</p>
<h3>[89:18] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you, Senator Harris. Thank you. vice president Pence. Thank you so much for being with us tonight. We want to thank also the University of Utah for it's hospitality and most of all, our thanks to all the Americans who watched this debate tonight again, our best wishes for a quick recovery to President Trump, the first lady and everyone who is battling Cove in 19. The second presidential debate is next week on October 15th, a town hall style debate in Miami. We hope you'll join us then. Good evening, E E. David. Dad, you don't have anything like that. How much money?</p>
