<h3>[0:00] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Good evening from Belmont University in Nashville, Tennessee. I'm Kristen Welker of NBC News, and I welcome you to the final 2020 presidential debate between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. Tonight's debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. It is conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the commission's health security adviser. The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent. No cheers, boos or other interruptions, except right now, as we welcome to the stage former Vice President Joe Biden and President Donald J. Trump.</p>
<h3>[1:00] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>and I do want to say a very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics at the beginning of each section. Each candidate will have two minutes uninterrupted to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone on Lee when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on. But on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start and we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, The first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans air in the hospital tonight with co vid, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from Cove it. So please be specific. How would you lead the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[2:06] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>So as you know, 2.2 million people modeled out were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It's all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now, if you notice the mortality rate is down 85%. Thea excess mortality rate is way down and much lower than almost any other country, and we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas. It's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona. It's now gone and there are some spikes and surges and other places they will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming. It's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks and it's going to be delivered. We have operation warp speed, which is the military is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it and I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me a therapeutic. I guess they would call it some people could say it was a cure, but I was in for a short period of time and I got better, very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight and now they say I'm immune whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody has been able to say that, but I'm immune more and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem. But I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the If you take a look at what we've done in terms off goggles and masks and gowns and everything else and in particular, ventilators were now making ventilators all over the world. Thousands and thousands a month distributing them all over the world. It will go away, and, as I say, we're rounding the turn. We're rounding the corner. It's going away.</p>
<h3>[4:08] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Okay, Former vice president Biden to you. How would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[4:15] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>220,000 Americans dead. You hear nothing else. I say tonight, here this Anyone who's responsible for not taking control, in fact, not saying I'm take no responsibility. Initially, anyone who's responsible for that many deaths should not remain as president of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are 1000 deaths a day now, 1000 deaths today and there are over 70,000 new cases per day compared to what's going on in Europe. As the New England Medical Journal said. They're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead the time between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks, the president's own advisors who told them we could save 100,000 lives and we're in a circumstance where the president thus far and still has no plan, no comprehensive plan, what I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing and rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards is how toe open up schools and open up businesses so they could be safe and give them the wherewithal. The financial resource is to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal, one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world, said for the first time ever that this, the way this president has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic and so, folks, I will take care of this. I will end this. I will make sure we have a plan.</p>
<h3>[6:03] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee? Is</p>
<h3>[6:15] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>no, it's not a guarantee, but it will be by the end of the year. But I think it has a good chance there to companies. I think within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.</p>
<h3>[6:24] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>You tell us which companies</p>
<h3>[6:25] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well and we have numerous others. Then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries in particular Europe.</p>
<h3>[6:37] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me follow up with you because this is new information you have set. A vaccine is coming soon. Within weeks. Now, your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated. And even then, they say, the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?</p>
<h3>[6:55] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>No. I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do. But we have our generals lined up one in particular. That's the head of logistics. And this is Avery Easy distribution for him. He's ready to go a soon as we have the vaccine and we expect to have 100 million vials. A soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.</p>
<h3>[7:15] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden your reaction. And just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in the vaccine if it were approved?</p>
<h3>[7:28] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Make sure Totally transparent. Have the scientists the world see it? No, it. Look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, he says, this is the same fellow told you this is gonna end by Easter. Last time, this the same fella who told you that? Don't worry. We're gonna end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter and he has no clear plan, and there's no prospect that there's gonna be a vaccine available for the majority of American people before the middle of next year.</p>
<h3>[7:56] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump your reaction, he says. You have no plan</p>
<h3>[7:58] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>to have a dark winter, and at all we're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't at the beginning when I closed and band China from coming in, heavily infected and then ultimately Europe. But China was in January. Months later, he was saying I was xenophobic. I did it too soon. Now he's saying, Oh, I should have I should have moved quicker but he didn't move quicker. He was months behind May many months behind May, and frankly, he ran the H one n one swine flu and it was a total disaster, far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him, who, as you know, was his chief of staff said it was catastrophic. It was horrible. We didn't know what we were doing. Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way every single move that he said we should make. That's what we've done. We've done all of it. But he was way behind us.</p>
<h3>[9:12] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden, Your response,</p>
<h3>[9:13] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>our responses. He is xenophobic, but not because he shut down access from China and he did it late after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there in China trying to get the Wuhan to determine what exactly the source for was. What did the president say in January? He said no. He said, This is he's being transparent. The president of China is being transparent. We almost debt of gratitude. We all we have to thank him and and then what happened was we started talking about using the defense Act to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again I go back to this. He had nothing. He did virtually nothing and then he gets out of the hospital and he talks about where this is. Don't worry, it's all be over soon.</p>
<h3>[10:01] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Come on. There's not another serious scientists in the world who</p>
<h3>[10:04] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>thinks it's gonna be over soon.</p>
<h3>[10:05] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump your reaction</p>
<h3>[10:06] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>be over soon. I say We're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the He has the ability to lock himself up. I don't know. He's obviously made a lot of money someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can't do that. By the way, I as the president couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that And Kirsten, every every meeting, I had every meeting I had, and I'd meet a lot of families, including gold star families and military families. Every meeting I had and I had to meet them, I had thio. It would be horrible to have canceled everything I said. You know, this is dangerous and you catch it and, you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot. Great doctors, great hospitals. And now I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation. We have to open our school and we can't close up our nation or you're not going toe have a nation.</p>
<h3>[11:13] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>And, of course, the 500 has said young people can get sick with Cove in 19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden. I want to talk broadly about strategy, though you have responded that 30 seconds, please. And then I have a question.</p>
<h3>[11:24] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>No Number one. He says that we're you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their out of habit, where their wife or husband, Waas, is gone, learning to live with it. Come on, we're dying with it because he has never said, you said. You said it's dangerous. When's the last time. Is it really dangerous? Still, we dangerous You tell the people, is dangerous</p>
<h3>[11:53] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>now. What should they do</p>
<h3>[11:54] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>about the danger? And you say I take no responsibility.</p>
<h3>[11:58] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me talk about your</p>
<h3>[11:59] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Excuse me, I e. I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that he came here. Its China's fault. And you know what? It's not Joe's fault that it came here either. Its China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world, including Europe and ourselves.</p>
<h3>[12:18] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden</p>
<h3>[12:19] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>The fact is that when we knew it was coming, when it hit, what happened? What did the president say? He said, Don't worry, it's going to go away, be gone by Easter. Don't worry the warm weather. Don't worry. Maybe inject bleach. He said he was kidding when he said that a lot of people thought it was serious. Ah, whole range of things, the president said. Even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose to 100,000 more people. President</p>
<h3>[12:45] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Trump, Look, perhaps just to finish this I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What? Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco, But when I closed, he said, This is a terrible thing, you xenophobic. I think he called me racist even and because I was closing it to China. Now he says, I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't</p>
<h3>[13:15] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I didn't say either of those things. You certainly e talked about xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.</p>
<h3>[13:26] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handle</p>
<h3>[13:29] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Thought I shouldn't have closed the border.</p>
<h3>[13:31] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Well, that's</p>
<h3>[13:32] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>that's obvious.</p>
<h3>[13:33] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Is that Do you want to respond to that quickly, Vice President. Okay, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this Mr Vice President. You suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger, depression, domestic and substance abuse outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus.</p>
<h3>[13:55] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It's his ineptitude that caused the caused the country to have to shut down in large part, why businesses have gone under why schools were closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns. Aerial. That's why he should have been instead of in a sand trap in his golf course. He should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.</p>
<h3>[14:25] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>But you haven't ruled out more shutdowns? Well, no,</p>
<h3>[14:28] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I'm not shutting down today, but there are look the need standard. The standard is if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up, more social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control under more control, but when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example, schools, schools, they need a lot of money to go open. They need to deal with ventilation system. They need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods. And he's refused to support that money. Or at least up to now.</p>
<h3>[15:06] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let's talk about schools. President Trump.</p>
<h3>[15:08] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>We have to respond, if I might</p>
<h3>[15:09] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>please. And then I have a phone,</p>
<h3>[15:11] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look. All he does is talk about shutdowns. But forget about him, his Democrat governors, Cuomo in New York. You look at what's going on in California. You look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all their shut down so tight and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about his shutdowns. No, we're not going to shut down and we have to open our schools, and it's like as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor the second time, he was fine. It just went away. Young people, I guess it's their immune system.</p>
<h3>[15:49] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me follow up with you, President Trump, you've demanded schools open in person and insist they could do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that's sending their Children to school will endanger not only their kids but also their teachers and families?</p>
<h3>[16:08] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not gonna have a country. You can't do this. We can't keep this country close. There's a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs. They're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know, I've said it often. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening. And he wants to close down. He'll close down the country. If one person in our in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down,</p>
<h3>[16:52] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden is</p>
<h3>[16:53] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>simply not true. We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time, we ought to be able to safely open. But what they need resource is toe open. You need to be able to, For example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business you need to have. If you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is in fact infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide the all the resource is that it needed to do this. And that is not inconsistent with saying that. What? We're gonna make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all your teachers out there not that many of your gonna die, So</p>
<h3>[17:36] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>don't worry</p>
<h3>[17:37] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>about it. So don't worry about it. Come on,</p>
<h3>[17:40] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly, though I</p>
<h3>[17:42] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>will say this. If you go and look at what's happened to New York, it's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglass, these air restaurants that are dying thes air businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglass is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic. It's thes air businesses that air dying. Joe, you can't do that to people. You just can't take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city for for so many years. I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.</p>
<h3>[18:17] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Take a look New York has done in terms of turning the curve down in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of the way he does blue states and red states. They're all the United States. And look at the states that air having such a spike in the coronavirus there. The red states there, the states in the Midwest of the States, in the Upper Midwest. That's where the spike is occurring significantly. But they're all Americans. They're all Americans. And what we have to do is say where these mask number one make sure we get the help that the businesses need that has money has already been passed to do that it's been out there since the beginning this summer, and</p>
<h3>[18:55] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>nothing's happened. President New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing</p>
<h3>[19:03] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump. What</p>
<h3>[19:04] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>did you say, Spike? Take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison now. It was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe. You can't let that happen. We have toe open up and we understand the disease. We have to protect our seniors. We have to protect our elderly. We have to protect especially our seniors, with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.</p>
<h3>[19:46] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section, President Trump. This week, you call Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, quote a disaster you described him and other medical experts is quote idiots. If you're not listening to them, who are you listening?</p>
<h3>[20:00] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Thio. I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. Get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, Don't wear masks. He did say, As you know, this is not going to be a problem. I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay, he said. This is not going to be a problem. We're not gonna have a problem at all. When Joe says that, I said, Anthony Fauci said. And others and many others, and I'm not knocking him a lot. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was. Nobody knew where it was coming from what it was. We've learned a lot. But Anthony said, don't wear masks now. He wants to wear mask. Anthony also said, If you look back exact words, he was his exact words. This is no problem. This is going to go away soon, so he's allowed to make mistakes. He happens to be a good person.</p>
<h3>[20:46] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice president Biden your response quickly and then we're gonna move on to the next section.</p>
<h3>[20:49] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Responses that think about what the president knew in January didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than much worse than the flu. He went on record and said to One of your colleagues recorded that In fact, he knew how dangerous it was, but he didn't want to tell us. He didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us. Americans don't panic. He panic. But I guess what? In the meantime, we find out in The New York Times the other day that, in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, This is a really dangerous thing And a memo out of that meeting, not from his administration, but from some of the brokers said Sell short because we've got to get moving. It's a dangerous Well, this is</p>
<h3>[21:33] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>I'm gonna give you 30 seconds to respond</p>
<h3>[21:36] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>with E. I don't know. Somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money and every time you raise money deals a major I could raise so much more money as president. And if somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street. You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street. Not may. I could blow away your records that, like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was.</p>
<h3>[22:17] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Alright, gentlemen, we're</p>
<h3>[22:18] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>going T</p>
<h3>[22:18] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>o average contribution. $43.</p>
<h3>[22:21] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right, we're gonna move on to our next section, which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained US voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[22:51] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I made it clear and I ask everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is that interferes in American elections, will pay a price. They will pay a price. It's been overwhelmingly clear this election. I won't even get into the last one this election that Russia has been involved. China has been involved with some degree, and now we learn that that that Iran is involved, they will pay a price. If I'm elected, they're interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty and the best of my knowledge. I don't think the president said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking them a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hadn't said a word to Putin about it, and I don't know what he has recently said. If anything to the Iranians, my guess is he'll probably be more out spoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this folks were in a situation where we have foreign company countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own own national security adviser told him that what is happening with his buddy? Well, gosh, I will. His buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawned. He's being fed information that is Russian, That is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next praised United States because they know I know them and they know me. I don't understand why this president is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan. When he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of the NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it, but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country interferes with us will in fact pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.</p>
<h3>[24:48] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump. Same question to you. Let me let me ask the question. You have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row. Now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this two minutes under.</p>
<h3>[25:00] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Let me respond to the first part as Joe Answer Joe got $3.5 million from Russia and it came through Putin because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow. And it was the mayor of Moscow's wife. And you got $3.5 million. Your family got $3.5 million. And, you know, someday you're gonna have to explain, Why did you get 3.5? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia now about your thing. Last night I knew all about that and through John, who was John Rutledge, who was fantastic DNA, he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose because there has been nobody tougher to Russia with between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO, you know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra, 130 billion going to $420 billion a year. That's to guard against Russia. I sold while he was selling pillows and sheets. I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher when Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad they took over the submarine port. You remember that very well. During your term during you and Barack Obama, they took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to him, but you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money, and they probably still are. But now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails, the horrible emails of the kind of money that you were raking in you and your family and your you were vice president when some of this was happening and it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it somebody just had a news conference a little while ago who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family? But what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you could do it right now.</p>

<p>Vice President Biden. You may respond, Thio And then I don't want to follow up on the election security.</p>
<h3>[27:10] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learned that this president paid 50 times The tax in China has a secret bank account with China, does business in China and in fact is talking about me taking money. I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever ever. Number one Number two This is a president. I have released all of my tax returns 22 years. Go look at them 22 years of my tax returns. You have not released the single solitary year of your tax return.</p>
<h3>[27:46] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>What are you</p>
<h3>[27:46] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>hiding? Why are you unwilling to? Foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China's paying a lot on your hotels and all your businesses all around the country all around the world, and China is building a new road to a new a golf course you have overseas. So what's</p>
<h3>[28:04] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>going on</p>
<h3>[28:05] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>here? Why don't release your tax return to stop talking about corruption?</p>
<h3>[28:08] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump, You're responsible.</p>
<h3>[28:09] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Civil. I called my accountants under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750 I asked them a week ago. I said, What did I pay? They said, Sir, you prepaid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax tens over the last number of years, tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid because at some point they think it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax, so I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that nobody tells you that. Excuse me, and it wasn't written. Whenever they write, they say they keep talking about $750 which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes. Number one number two I don't make money from China, You dio I don't make money from Ukraine. You dio I don't make money from Russia. You</p>
<h3>[29:08] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>made three and</p>
<h3>[29:08] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>a half million dollars Joe and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know. Maybe you're not, But you're the big man. I think your sense that we have to give 10% to the big men. Joe, What's that all about? It's terrible.</p>
<h3>[29:26] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Gentlemen, I wanna ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do</p>
<h3>[29:35] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>you happen? Is the</p>
<h3>[29:37] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>deadline for when you're gonna release? I</p>
<h3>[29:38] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>get treated worse than the tea party got treated because I have a lot of people in there. Deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal. It was all settled. Until I decide to run for president, I get treated very badly by the I. R s. Very unfairly. But we had a deal. All done As soon as we're completed with the deal. I want to release it, but I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance is called pre paying your taxes. I paid it.</p>
<h3>[30:08] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly, respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.</p>
<h3>[30:19] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Why did he's been saying this for four years? Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You've been saying for four years. You're gonna reduce your taxes. Nobody knows that, Mr President. What they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that air so low. When Last time he said what he paid, he said, I only paid that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system. Come on. Come on, folks. So,</p>
<h3>[30:46] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump and then I want to get to two questions to both of yours.</p>
<h3>[30:50] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats and FBI agents all over the place spent $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns. And they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. 48 million. I guarantee if I spent one million on you, Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of money that your family has taken I mean, your brother made money in Iraq. Millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune. And it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it and you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.</p>
<h3>[31:44] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden. There have been questions about the work your son has done in China and for a Ukrainian energy company. When you were vice president. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?</p>
<h3>[32:00] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal with regard to Ukraine. We had this whole question about whether or not because he was on the board. I later learned of a Briz MMA, a company that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment testifying under oath, who worked for him, said, I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one single solitary thing was out of line, not a single thing. Number one number two The guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about May, which they would not do and did not do because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about what are you talking about? China? I have not had the only guy made money from China. Is this guy the only one Nobody else has made money from China.</p>
<h3>[33:00] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>President Trump, do it.</p>
<h3>[33:02] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me let me ask my question to</p>
<h3>[33:03] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>you. Could I just want one thing very good. Son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly, no longer in the military service. I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job as soon as he became vice president. But Rissman, not the best Look. Not the best reputation in the world. I hear they paid him 183,000 month. Listen to this. 183. And they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, right? And he had no energy.</p>
<h3>[33:31] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>I'm gonna let the vice president's onto that quickly. And then I need to get to a question to you.</p>
<h3>[33:34] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>No basis for that. Everybody investigated that. No one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.</p>
<h3>[33:39] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week which was referenced does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?</p>
<h3>[33:55] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to, which is everybody knows about it. It's listed. The bank account was in 20 13. That's what it was. It was open to do. It was closed in 2015 I believe. And then I decided because I was going to do I was thinking about doing a deal in China. Like millions of other people. I was thinking about it and I decided I'm not going to do it. Didn't like it. I decided not to do it. Had an account open and I close it. Okay, Excuse May. And then unlike him where he's vice president and he does business, I then decided to run for president. After that, that was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president. Big difference. He is the vice president of the United States and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich there like a vacuum cleaner there. Sucking Okay, everything. Thank you. We do need to move</p>
<h3>[34:57] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>on. I do want to ask you Vice President Biden about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have. Of course. President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific? What would that look like</p>
<h3>[35:17] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>what I'd make China do is play by the international rules. Not like he has done. He has caused the deficit. The China to go up, not down with China up, not down. We're making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property you have to get have a partner in China is 51%. We would not do that at all. Number one, number two We're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with she, that and when I was still vice president, he said, We're setting up air identification zones in the in the South China Sea. You can't fly through them. I said, we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B 52 b B one bombers through it. We're not gonna pay attention. They have to play by the rules. And what's he do? He embraces guys like thieves, thugs like in North Korea and and the and the Chinese president and Putin and others. And he folks his finger that I have all of our friends, all of our allies we make up only were 25% 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China, These are the rules you play by them or you're gonna pay the price for not paying by them economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did in upholding steel tariffs on a range of other things. And we were president, vice president.</p>
<h3>[36:37] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right, let's talk about North Korea. Lets</p>
<h3>[36:39] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>me know I have to respond to that.</p>
<h3>[36:40] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Okay, very quickly. And then we're gonna have</p>
<h3>[36:42] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>a half dollars from China toe after spending 10 minutes in office and being in Air Force to number one number two. There's a very strong email talking about your family, wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.</p>
<h3>[36:58] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump on China policy, though what's no. But what are you going to dio? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay? You said your</p>
<h3>[37:06] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>personal China is paying their paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion sessions. I just gave $28 billion to</p>
<h3>[37:14] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>our farmers tax China That's what taxpayers money e</p>
<h3>[37:20] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>the taxpayers. It's called China. China paid 28 billion, and you know what they did to pay it, Joe. They devalued their currency, and they also paid up. And you know who got the money? Our farmers are great farmers because they were targeted. You never charged them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel because they were killing our steel industry. We were not gonna have a steel in the UK, and now we have a steel</p>
<h3>[37:43] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>vice president. Biden your response, please.</p>
<h3>[37:45] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Our responses. Look, this isn't about there's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly. Right now, you're sitting at the kitchen table this morning, deciding, but we can't get new tires the ball because we have to wait another month or so Or are we gonna be able to pay the mortgage or who's gonna tell her she can't go back. Thio Community College There, the decisions you're making in the middle class. Families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymont. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your family's. But that's the last thing he wants to talk about.</p>
<h3>[38:30] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>I want</p>
<h3>[38:30] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>to say</p>
<h3>[38:30] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>I want to talk about North Korea e 0 10 seconds, Mr President. 10</p>
<h3>[38:35] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>seconds. Political statement. Let's get off this China thing. And then he looks the family around the table, everything. Just a typical politician. When I see that,</p>
<h3>[38:43] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>let's talk about a typical politician. That's</p>
<h3>[38:45] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>why I got elected.</p>
<h3>[38:46] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let's talk.</p>
<h3>[38:47] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Let's get off the subject of China. Let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you could do better.</p>
<h3>[38:52] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>We're going to talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times you've talked about your beautiful letters with him. You've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test. And yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship. You forge just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the</p>
<h3>[39:16] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>next. So when I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House right at the beginning. Had a great conversation, is supposed to be 15 minutes, and it was well over an hour, he said. The biggest problem we have with North is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what? It would be a nuclear war. And he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy. But he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of a relationship. We have a very good relationship and there's no war. And, you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, Oh, there's gonna be trouble I said, No, they're not because he's not going to do that And I was right. Look, instead of being in a war where millions of people sold, you know, is 25 miles away million's and million's 32 million people, and so millions of people would be dead right now.</p>
<h3>[40:07] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump. That's 32nd Vice president Biden to you. North Korea conducted for nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rain in this persistent threat?</p>
<h3>[40:18] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Because I'd make it clear which were making clear to China they had to be part of the deal because here's the route. I made it clear and as a spokesperson administration. When I went to China that I said, Why you moving your missile defense up so close? Why you moving more forces here? Why you continue to do, uh, military maneuvers with South Korea? I said, because North Korea is a problem and we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're gonna make sure we can control them and make sure they cannot hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up and help. If not, it's going to continue. What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea. He's talked about his good buddy, who's a thug. Ah, thug. And he talks about how we're better off, and they are have much more capable missiles able to reach US territory much more easily than ever did before.</p>
<h3>[41:07] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me follow up with you. Vice President Biden. You said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him</p>
<h3>[41:16] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>on the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get that the Korean Peninsula should be nuclear free zone?</p>
<h3>[41:24] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right, let's move on to American families.</p>
<h3>[41:27] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>They very quickly. 10 seconds. They tried to meet with him. He wouldn't do it. He didn't like Obama. He didn't like him. He wouldn't do it. Not that they respond to that would do it. And that's okay. You know what? North Korea. We're not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don't listen. Having a good, really President Trump with leaders of our country have</p>
<h3>[41:48] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>a lot of countries have a lot of questions to</p>
<h3>[41:50] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>get you to</p>
<h3>[41:50] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>respond. And we had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe. The rest of Europe come on, is the reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we're gonna talk about denuclearization. We're not gonna legitimize you. We're going to continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That's why he wouldn't meet with us.</p>
<h3>[42:12] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right? I didn't want You want to talk about American mess President Trump. Okay,</p>
<h3>[42:17] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess. And in fact, if you remember the first two or three months, there was a very dangerous period of my first three months before we sort of worked things out a little bit. There was a very day they left us a mess and Obama would be, I think, the first to say it was the single biggest problem. He thought that our country</p>
<h3>[42:39] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Okay, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care. As you both know today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court. Justice Amy Coney, Barrett and Health Care is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court and your administration. Mr President is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the Supreme Court does overturn that law. Those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[43:16] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>First of all, have already done something that nobody thought was possible through the Legislature. I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obama care, as we call it, the individual mandate, where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminated. It's gone. Now It's in court because Obama care is no good. But then I made a decision. Run it as well as you can to my people. Great people run it as well as you can. I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it, Uh, premiums. Air down. Everything is down. Here is the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to dio is terminated. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work if we don't when we will have to run it and we'll have Obama care. But it'll be better run. But it no longer is Obama care because without the individual mandate, it's much different. Pre existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to dio is a much better health care. Much better will always protect people with preexisting. So I'd like to terminate Obama care, come up with a brand new, beautiful healthcare. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them and we might even have the house by that time. And I think we're going to win the house. Okay, you'll see. But I think we're gonna win the house but come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private healthcare farm or than we're talking about with Obama care. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies thes air people that love their healthcare, people that have been successful middle income people been successful. They have 180 million plans 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine, he won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job on health care, and we're going to do even better.</p>
<h3>[45:18] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Okay, Vice President Biden. Yes, This is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obama care. So my question is, what is your plan? If the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, you have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[45:32] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>What I'm going to do is pass obamacare with a public option. Become biden care. The public option is an option that says that if you in fact do not have the wherewithal to be, if you qualify for Medicaid and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically enrolled providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's gonna happen. Secondly, we're gonna make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance The reason why I had such a fight for with 20 candidates for the nomination was I support private insurance. That's why I did not. One single person with private insurance would lose their insurance under my plan. Nor did they under Obama care. They did not lose their insurance unless they chose. They wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're gonna make sure you're in a situation that we actually protect pre existing. There's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None. Zero. You can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we've been waiting for since 17 18 19 and 20. The fact I still have a few more minutes. I know you're getting anxious. The fact is that he's already cost the American people because of this terrible handling of the covert virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who haven't under Obamacare and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions and all the people from covert are gonna have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?</p>
<h3>[47:27] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden. It relates to something that President Trump said he's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government? They</p>
<h3>[47:44] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>say it's ridiculous. It's like saying that, you know, we're the idea that the fact that there's a public option that people can choose that makes the socialist plan look the difference between the president. I think health care is not a privilege. It's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions, as well as as well as a whole range of other people who in fact are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives, and this is going to give some people an opportunity on opportunity to have health care for their Children. How many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed tonight, wondering what in God's name you're going to do if you get sick because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people and affordable rate. That's what I dio</p>
<h3>[48:36] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>president. Trust</p>
<h3>[48:36] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>me, he was for 47 years. He didn't do it. He was. Now there is vice president for eight years, and it's not like it was 25 years ago. It was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine, and it's not that he wants it. His vice president. I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders, and once it even more. Bernie Sanders wants it. The Democrats wanted you're going to have socialized medicine, just like you went with fracking. We're not gonna have fracking. We're going to stop fracking. We're going to stop fracking. Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination where he got very lucky to get it, and he goes to Pennsylvania and he says, Oh, we're gonna have fracking and you never ask that question. And by the way, so far I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say, But somebody should ask the question. Hey, goes for a year. There will be</p>
<h3>[49:30] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>a way to have a number of we have a number of topics. Way, question we're going to get. Get</p>
<h3>[49:37] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>the same thing with socialized Vice</p>
<h3>[49:39] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President. Your response, please.</p>
<h3>[49:40] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>My response is people deserve to have affordable health care, period, period, period, period. And the Biden care proposal will, in fact, to provide for that affordable healthcare, lower premiums. And what we're gonna do is gonna cost some money. It's gonna cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it, and they're gonna be have lower premiums. You can buy into the better plans. The cheaper plans lower your premiums, deal with unexpected building and have your drug prices dropped significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care. Not just</p>
<h3>[50:13] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>when he says what he says. Public option. He's talking about socialized medicine. And when he and health care, when he talks about a public option. He's talking about destroying your Medicare totally district and destroying your Social Security, and this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. He tried it in a state. His governor was a very liberal governor. They want to make it work. It was president work. It doesn't president, very</p>
<h3>[50:41] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>confused. He thinks he's running against somebody else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden he's running against and the idea that we're in a situation, that they're going to destroy Medicare. This is the guy that the actuary Medicare said, if in fact, as that so security, if in fact, he continues to with whole his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt in by 2023 with no way to make up for it. This is the guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So</p>
<h3>[51:17] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>no, I don't</p>
<h3>[51:17] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare. Come on.</p>
<h3>[51:24] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>He tried to get him. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security years ago.</p>
<h3>[51:33] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right, let's move. This isn't when</p>
<h3>[51:35] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>they announced</p>
<h3>[51:36] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>the president, I have to move on to the next question.</p>
<h3>[51:38] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>They said. Stock market boom. If I'm elected, if he's elected, the stock market will crash.</p>
<h3>[51:43] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Okay, let's move on to the next question very quickly.</p>
<h3>[51:47] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Look, the idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening where I come from in Scranton and Claymont, that people don't live off of the stock market just in just in the last 33 years during this crisis, said the billionaires in this country made according toe the Wall Street 700 billion Mawr dollars. 700 billion more dollars Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens</p>
<h3>[52:16] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>to them? 401 k 401 k is through the roof are through the roof, and he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like one of he lived there for a short period</p>
<h3>[52:28] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>of time.</p>
<h3>[52:28] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Before I even knew we're</p>
<h3>[52:30] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>gonna move on.</p>
<h3>[52:30] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>The people of Pennsylvania,</p>
<h3>[52:32] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>let me move on to my next question. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, eight million more Americans have fallen into poverty and more families air going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr President, why haven't you been able to get them the help? They need 30 seconds here</p>
<h3>[52:53] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.</p>
<h3>[52:57] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>You're the president.</p>
<h3>[52:58] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>I do, but I still have to get unfortunate. That's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything because she'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3rd. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans and it's gone through, including the Democrats. In all fairness, this one she doesn't want. It's near the election because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.</p>
<h3>[53:26] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Alright, Mr vice president</p>
<h3>[53:28] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>of the Republican leader in the in the United States Senate, said he can't pass it. He will not be able to pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn't he talking to his Republican friends?</p>
<h3>[53:38] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me follow up with you, vice president, because let me let me ask Vice President Biden a question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not push the Democrats to get a deal for the American people?</p>
<h3>[53:49] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I have and they have pushed it.</p>
<h3>[53:50] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like it's not new. It's been out</p>
<h3>[53:57] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>there. This heroes Act has been sitting there and look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion I was able to get $145 billion. The local communities that have to balance their budgets and states have to balance the budget so then have to fire fire, have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers so they could keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that they have not done a thing for them, and Mitch McConnell said,</p>
<h3>[54:27] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Let them go bankrupt. Let</p>
<h3>[54:29] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>them go bankrupt. Come on,</p>
<h3>[54:31] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>what's the matter Bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these kids. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets, too. People that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them and what that does. And I'd love to do that. I'd love to help him, but what that does everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of spending on things that had nothing to do with Cove. It as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.</p>
<h3>[55:15] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>I</p>
<h3>[55:16] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>get elected. I'm not gonna I'm running is a proud Democrat. I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see as American, United States and folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off whether the red or blue cops, firefighters first responders because teachers, because they have to balance their budget and the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.</p>
<h3>[55:46] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>I want to talk about the minimum wage. Gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses on business owners Thes days. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 federal minimum.</p>
<h3>[56:00] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I do because I think one of the things we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now. Those small businesses, you got one in six of them going under. They're not gonna be able to make it back. They passed a a package that allows us to be able to call p P P. Money is supposed to go to help them do everything from organized how they can deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools how they can make classroom smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help. The businesses, as well as the schools need the help. But this these guys will not help them is not giving them any of the money.</p>
<h3>[56:41] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>We're gonna move on</p>
<h3>[56:42] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>to the way we have a small businesses by raising the minimum wage. That's not helping. I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York. New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state</p>
<h3>[56:57] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>up, very happy</p>
<h3>[56:58] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>to help. It's very important. We have to help our small businesses.</p>
<h3>[57:01] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>How are</p>
<h3>[57:02] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>you helping your small businesses When you're forcing wages? What's gonna happen and what's been proven toe happen is when you do that these small businesses fire many of their employees.</p>
<h3>[57:11] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>You said. Clearly, you consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. That's still the case,</p>
<h3>[57:20] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>and I would consider it to an extent in a really illustration, what in a second administration, but not to a level that's gonna put all these businesses out of business, It should be a state option. Look, every in different places. I know different places. They're all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad in other places. Other states, $15.</p>
<h3>[57:41] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump. Thank you. Quick response. Vice President Biden.</p>
<h3>[57:44] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Two jobs, one job, Phoebe below poverty. People are making 678 bucks an hour Thes first responders we all clap for as they come down the street because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business. That is simply not true.</p>
<h3>[58:10] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>We're gonna talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration now, gentlemen, and we're gonna talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated Children from their parents at the border. At least 4000 kids. You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy. But the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 Children. So how will these families ever be reunited?</p>
<h3>[58:33] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people cartels, and they're brought here and they used to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger borders we've ever had Were over 400 miles of brand new wall. You see the numbers and we let people in, but they have to come in legally and they come in through.</p>
<h3>[58:54] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>But how will you let</p>
<h3>[58:55] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>me just tell you what their family just saying. They built cages, you know, they used to say I built the cages and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper. It was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, Look at these cages. President Trump built them, and then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him they built. Yes, we're working on it. Very. We're trying very hard, but a lot of these kids come out without the parents. They come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs.</p>
<h3>[59:24] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response. And then another question to</p>
<h3>[59:28] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>you. These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. They really tough were really strong and guess what they cannot is not. Coyotes didn't bring them over. Their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughing stock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation.</p>
<h3>[59:54] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me ask you</p>
<h3>[59:55] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>first they did it. We changed the policy response way changed. They built the cages. Who built the cages? Let's talk about who built the cage is just</p>
<h3>[60:05] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>talk about what we're talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped. Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 of sets of those parents And those kids air alone,</p>
<h3>[60:20] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>nowhere to go, Nowhere to go.</p>
<h3>[60:23] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>It's criminal. It's</p>
<h3>[60:24] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>criminal! Christian,</p>
<h3>[60:26] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>I will say this. They went down. We brought reporters everything. They are so well taken care of there in facilities that was so clean. Some of them haven't. Goodnight. Just ask one question. Who built the cages? I'd love you to ask him that. Who built the cages?</p>
<h3>[60:41] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me ask about your immigration policy. Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?</p>
<h3>[60:59] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Because it made a mistake made to it took too long to get it right. Took too long to get it right. I'll be president. United States, not Vice president, United States. And the fact is, I've made it very clear. Within 100 days I'm going to send to the United States Congress ah, pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people and all of those so called dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy and they want to do that is there going to a country they've never seen before? I can imagine you're five years old. Your parents are taking across the Rio Grande River and it's illegal and you say, Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not going to go with you. They've been here, many of them. A model says over 20,000 of our first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.</p>
<h3>[61:59] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Still, he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do, and I've changed without having a specific. We got rid of catch and release. We got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with. But he had eight years. He was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep Children in.</p>
<h3>[62:23] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden Your response.</p>
<h3>[62:24] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>The catch and release. You know what he's talking about there. If in fact you had a family came across and they were arrested they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released and guess what? They showed up for a hearing. This is the first president of the United States America. There's anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country that's never happened before in America. That's never happened before. In America, you come to United States and you make your case that I seek asylum based on the following on the following premise. Why I deserve it. Under American law, they're sitting in squalor on the other side of the</p>
<h3>[63:01] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>river. President Trump response.</p>
<h3>[63:04] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>So it just shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws, catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in. We would take their name. We have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back. We have to send ice out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say Come back in two years. Three years. We're gonna give you a court case. You need Perry Mason. We're gonna give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe, they never come back. Only the really. I hate to say this, but those with the lowest I Q. They might come</p>
<h3>[63:51] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>back. OK, President Trump, Let's give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're gonna move on to the next Joe Vice President. Biden Your response?</p>
<h3>[63:58] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>No, the law. What he's telling you is simply not true. We'll</p>
<h3>[64:01] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>check out they don't come back. Check it out. All right, let's move. We don't have to worry about terminated it. So we have to worry about.</p>
<h3>[64:07] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let's move on to the next</p>
<h3>[64:08] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>525 kids, not knowing where in God's name they're gonna be in lost their parents.</p>
<h3>[64:12] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right, let's talk about our next section, which is race in America, and I want to talk about the way black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called the Talk. It happens regardless of class and income, parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their Children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President. In the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their Children?</p>
<h3>[64:49] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker, and she's also She's written a lot about this. She's has a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania social and you know, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90% African American, was toe learn. Maura, about what was going on. What I didn't. I never had to tell my daughter. If she's pulled over, make sure she puts for a traffic stop. Put both hands on top of the wheel and don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child when you're walking down the street. Don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street making sure that you in fact, if you get pulled over just yes, sir, No, sir. Hands on top of the wheel because you are in fact the victim, whether you're, ah, person making 300,000 child of $300,000 a year person or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism America and we have always said we've never lived up to it, that we hold these truths to be self evident. All men and women are created equal. Well, guess what we have never, ever lived up to, but we've always constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion, not exclusion. This is the first president to come along and says, That's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling. Better access to opportunity. Thio borrow money to start businesses All the things we can do, and I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth as well as it is to be free from violence.</p>
<h3>[66:41] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump. Same question to you. And let me remind you of the question. I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their Children?</p>
<h3>[66:50] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994 when he did such harm to the black community and they were called and he called them Super Predators. And he said that he said, It's super predators and they have never lived that down 1990 for your crime bill superpredators. Nobody has Dunmore for the black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, possible exception. But the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform. Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance of doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms, I had a twist to get that done. It was not a pretty picture, and everybody knows it, including some very liberal people that cried in my office. They cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, Gee, we have to defeat him Criminal justice Reform, Prison Reform Opportunity Zones With Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It's one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made biggest beneficiary the black and Hispanic communities and then historically black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office. I love some of those guys. They were great. They came into the office and they said I said what do you do it After three years, I said, Why do you keep coming back? Because we have no funding. I said, You don't have to come back every year. We have to come back because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did 10 year long term funding and I gave them more money than they asked for because I said, I think you need MAWR And I said, The only bad part about this is I may never see you again because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities,</p>
<h3>[68:54] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>okay? And we're gonna talk about both of your records. But your response to that</p>
<h3>[68:58] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>response to that as I never ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is in 2000, though, after the crime bill had been in in in in the law for a while. This is the guy who said the problem of the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail and go on my website, get to quote the date when he said it. Not enough people. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs and the people who are going to maraud our cities. This is a guy who in the Central Park, 55 innocent black kids. He continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were. None of them were guilty off what the crime of the crimes they were suggested look and talk about he granted. He did, in fact, let 20 people. He commuted 20 people sentences we committed over 1000 people, sentences over 1000. The very law he's talking about is the law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we the federal prison system, was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration and one of these things we should be doing, there should be no no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion the states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system. And that's what I'm going to dio.</p>
<h3>[70:29] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago? Even less than that? Why didn't you? Vice President, you keep talking about all these things you're going to do, and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing. You know, Joe, I I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama because you did a poor job. If I thought you did a good job, I would have never run. I would have never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now. You're a politician. I ran because of you.</p>
<h3>[70:59] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right. Vice President Biden, your response to that. And then I do have some questions for both of</p>
<h3>[71:03] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>you. I'll tell you what I hope he doesn't look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am. You know who he is. You know his character. You know my character. You know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am character of the country is on the ballot. Are characters in the ballot looked at this closely?</p>
<h3>[71:27] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me ask them please respond and</p>
<h3>[71:30] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>then we're gonna have true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries Ereck. If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how your this innocent baby Joe they're calling you a corrupt politician. Nobody.</p>
<h3>[71:45] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump. I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about shop from President Trump talking about race right now. And I do want to stay on the issue of race. President Trump, just</p>
<h3>[71:55] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>respond to that. Please look very clear. Our 50 former national intelligence folks who said that What this he's accusing me off is a Russian plant. They have said that this is has all the care</p>
<h3>[72:08] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>45</p>
<h3>[72:09] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>former heads of the CIA. Both parties say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes that except of his and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.</p>
<h3>[72:19] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. And that's exactly what this is. Exactly what this is, where he's going. The lottery is Russia.</p>
<h3>[72:29] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Gentlemen, I want to stay on the issue</p>
<h3>[72:31] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>of race. You okay? Here we go again with Russia.</p>
<h3>[72:34] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>We're going to continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the black lives matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting White power to millions of your supporters. You've said that black professional athletes exercising their First Amendment rights should be fired. What</p>
<h3>[72:51] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>do</p>
<h3>[72:51] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?</p>
<h3>[72:58] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>What? You have to understand the first time I ever heard of black lives matter. They were chanting pigs in a blanket, talking about police pigs, pigs talking about our police pigs in a blanket fry them like bacon. I said, That's a horrible thing. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of black lives matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.</p>
<h3>[73:30] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>What do you say to Americans who are concerned by that e. I</p>
<h3>[73:33] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>mean, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done in prison reform and opportunity zones. I took care of black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very it makes me sad because I am. I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark. But I don't care who's in the audience. I'm the least racist person in this room.</p>
<h3>[74:01] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Okay, Vice President Biden, let me ask you very quickly and then I have a follow up question for you.</p>
<h3>[74:05] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single Frey cyst fire. Every single one started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he's gonna get rid of those Mexican rapist. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board, he says to about the poor boys. Last time we're on stage and he said I told to stand down and stand ready. Come on. This guy is a dog whistle about it. Bigas a foghorn.</p>
<h3>[74:39] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump, I'm gonna give you 10 seconds to respond. Then I have a</p>
<h3>[74:42] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>follow. You made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean, you said Abraham Lincoln. Where did that? No, no, I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the black community. And I didn't say I'm Abraham Lincoln. I said, not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the black community. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill which put God tens of thousands of black men, mostly in jail.</p>
<h3>[75:14] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right, you know what they remember? Because if</p>
<h3>[75:17] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>you look at what's happening with the voting right</p>
<h3>[75:18] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>now, they remember that</p>
<h3>[75:20] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>they treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what's happening out there.</p>
<h3>[75:24] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden. Let me give you a chance to respond. Within this context, crime bills that you supported in the eighties and nineties contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession their sons, their brothers, their fathers, their uncles, whose families air still to this day, some of them suffering the consequences. So speak to those families. Why should they vote for you?</p>
<h3>[75:46] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>One of the things is that in the eighties we passed 100%. All 100 senators voted for a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change the sense and particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offenses. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money. That's why set up drug courts, which were never funded by Republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment, treatment? That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because I think the American people have now seen that. In fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws relating the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.</p>
<h3>[76:39] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk. No action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it. Oh, that's what I'm going to do when I become president. You were vice president along with Obama as your president, your leader for eight years. Why didn't you get it done yet? Eight years to get it done. Now you're saying you're going to get it done because you're all talking. No action.</p>
<h3>[77:00] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>We got a lot of it done. We released 38 38,000 prisoners left from you got 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have There were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We, in fact, were the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern and practice of police departments and what they were doing, how they're conducting themselves. I could go on, but we begin the process. We began the process we lost in election. That's why I'm running toe win back that election and change his terrible</p>
<h3>[77:32] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>policy. You just one question. Why didn't you do it in the eight years? A short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this. You put tens of thousands of mostly black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're gonna get You're gonna undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama. You know my job. Because you're all talk and no action.</p>
<h3>[77:57] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden. And then we're gonna move on to the next section,</p>
<h3>[78:00] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>had a Republican Congress, the cancer.</p>
<h3>[78:06] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>You gotta talk him into it. All right? You got to talk him into it.</p>
<h3>[78:11] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>We're gonna move on to our next section</p>
<h3>[78:12] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>like I did with criminal justice reform. I have talked Democrats into</p>
<h3>[78:16] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>gentlemen, you're We're running out of time, so we got to get on to climate change. Please. You both have very different visions on climate change, President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs for each of you. How would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.</p>
<h3>[78:43] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>So we have the Trillion trees program. We have so many different programs. I do love the environment. But what I want is the cleanest crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed. Obama goes with all the time, not Joe. I haven't heard Joe used the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents her means. But I have heard Obama used it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years under this administration. We are working so well with industry. But here's what we can't dio. Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord. I took us out because we were gonna have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there. They did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would have been it would have been, it would have destroyed our businesses. So you ready? We have done an incredible job. Environmentally, we have the cleanest. They're the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.</p>
<h3>[80:16] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President, we</p>
<h3>[80:17] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>haven't destroyed our industries.</p>
<h3>[80:19] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden, Two minutes to you. Uninterrupted</p>
<h3>[80:23] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>climate change and climate warming. Global warming is the next essential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to do with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world we don't have much time. We're gonna pass the point of no return with the next 8 to 10 years. Former years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up, to limit the aluminum emissions will put us in a position where we're gonna be in riel trouble. Here's what we have a great opportunity. I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor. The people worried about jobs, toe support, my climate plan because what it does, it will create millions of new, good paying jobs we're going to invest in for example, 600,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market of the future. In the meantime, China is doing that. We're gonna be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take four million existing billion buildings and two million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak. Is much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and is going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening and what right now. By the way, Wall Street firms indicated that my plan, my my plan will in fact create 18.6 million jobs, seven million more than hiss this from Wall Street, and I'll create $1 trillion Maurin economic growth than his proposal does not on climate just on the economy,</p>
<h3>[82:16] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Trump</p>
<h3>[82:17] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>came out and said very strongly $6500 will be taken away from families under his plan that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know the if you look at his place his environment plan, you know who developed it, a O. C. Plus three. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate, and they're all hopping through hoops for a O. C. Plus three. Look, they're real. Plan costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that when he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because I want to make bigger windows into smaller windows, as's faras, they're concerned. If you had no window, it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen, and this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it could be good Politically. They want to spend ah, $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It's $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny small windows, mean and many other things and many other thing.</p>
<h3>[83:33] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me have the vice president on and we're running out of time and we have a lot</p>
<h3>[83:36] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>more questions. Royal. So</p>
<h3>[83:38] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>let's hear from the vice president. I have a number of more question.</p>
<h3>[83:40] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>I don't</p>
<h3>[83:40] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>know where he comes from. Don't know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion. Give me a break. This plan was This is planted, endorsed by every major, every major environmental group and every labor group Labor because they know the future lies the future lies and us being able to breathe. And they know they're good jobs and getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are is the electric, the excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer. Windmills is the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages 45 50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner. If we go the route I'm proposing.</p>
<h3>[84:29] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President</p>
<h3>[84:30] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Trump may weigh our energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had to fight war over because we needed their energy. We're energy independent. I know more about when than you do. It's extremely expensive, kills all the birds. It's very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China and the fumes coming up. If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful yet to to really run our big, beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world. So it's all a pipe dream. But you know what? We'll dio we're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry you want. And what about fracking?</p>
<h3>[85:29] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Alright, let me Let me let me allow Vice President</p>
<h3>[85:33] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>never said I oppose fracking.</p>
<h3>[85:36] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>You said it</p>
<h3>[85:36] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>on tape. I did show the tape. Put it on your website.</p>
<h3>[85:40] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Put it on, put it on</p>
<h3>[85:41] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>the website. The fact of the matter is flat line.</p>
<h3>[85:44] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Would you allow banning fracking?</p>
<h3>[85:46] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I do rule up anti fracking because the answer we need, we need other industries to transition to get to ultimately a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking overtime is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking, capture the emissions from gas. We can do that, and we can do that by investing money into anybody. It's a transition to that.</p>
<h3>[86:13] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>I have one more question in this part of that</p>
<h3>[86:15] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>he was against tracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. I am against fracking until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said. But you know what? Pennsylvania. He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against</p>
<h3>[86:30] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>fracking on federal land. I said, No fracking and oil on federal.</p>
<h3>[86:34] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Let me ask this final question in this section, and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump. People of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants in Texas. There are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?</p>
<h3>[86:56] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>The families that we're talking about our employed heavily and they're making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produced for Hispanic or black for Asian, it's nine times greater the percentage gain than it was under in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely nine times more. Now somebody lives. I have not heard the numbers or the statist statistics that you're saying, but they're making a tremendous amount of money economically. We saved it, and I saved it again. A number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic, we saved it. We got Say what you want about relationship. We got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back way back. We saved our oil industry, and now it's very vibrant together. Everybody has very inexpensive gasoline.</p>
<h3>[87:52] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>President Biden your response and then we're gonna have a final question for both of you.</p>
<h3>[87:57] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>My response is that those people live on what they call fence lines. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that in fact pollute chemical plants and oil plants and refineries. The Pollute I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware, and all the more oil refineries and Marcus Hook in the Delaware River than there is any place, including in Houston at the time. When my mom get in the car, when? When their first frost to drive me to school, turning the winter weather. They've been oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is, those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollutions that the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities</p>
<h3>[88:42] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Okay, I have one final</p>
<h3>[88:44] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>would be closed down it. Would you close down</p>
<h3>[88:47] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>the other way have a transition from the oil industry? Yes, I transition, but it is a big statement because I would stop</p>
<h3>[88:54] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Why would you do that?</p>
<h3>[88:55] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Because the oil industry pollutes significantly, I said. Here's the deal, but that's a big step. Well, if you let me finish the statement because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time and I'd stop giving to the oil industry, I'd stop giving them federal subsidies. He won't get federal subsidies to the gas and shoot me to the Thio Solar and win why we're giving it to oil industry.</p>
<h3>[89:22] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>We actually dio solar and wind. That may be the biggest statement in terms of business. That's the biggest day. Okay? Because basically what he's saying is he is going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that? Texas. We remember that Pennsylvania Oklahoma</p>
<h3>[89:37] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Vice President Biden Let me give you 10 seconds to respond, and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden.</p>
<h3>[89:43] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>He takes everything out of context. But the point is look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2035 is an energy production by 2050. Totally.</p>
<h3>[89:56] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Alright, Once you gonna get China to know we're finished</p>
<h3>[89:58] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>with you going to get China?</p>
<h3>[90:00] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>Final question we have. I'm</p>
<h3>[90:01] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>gonna rejoin first accord to make China abide by what they agreed. Thio</p>
<h3>[90:06] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>pushes about leadership, gentlemen. And this first question does go to you, President Trump. Imagine this is your inauguration day. What will you say in your address? Who American To Americans who did not vote for you. You'll each have one minute starting with you.</p>
<h3>[90:22] Donald Trump</h3>
<p>We have to make a country totally successful as it was prior to the plague coming in from China. Now we're rebuilding it and we're doing record numbers. 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time, etcetera. But I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me, they wanted to get together. We had the best black unemployment numbers in the history of our country. Hispanic women, Asian people with diplomas with no diplomas. M I T graduates number one in the class. Everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify. Success is going to bring us together we? We are on the road to success, but I'm cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody's taxes. And he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Your 401 case will go to hell, and it'll be a very, very sad day for this country.</p>
<h3>[91:24] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right, Vice President Biden. Same question to you. What will you say during your inaugural address to Americans who did not vote</p>
<h3>[91:31] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>for you? I will say I'm an American president. Represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me. And I'm going to make sure that your represented I'm gonna give you hope we're gonna move. We're gonna choose science over fiction. We're gonna choose hope over fear. We're gonna choose to move forward because they have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better. We can grow this economy. We can deal with systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run and moved and motivated by clean energy creating millions of new jobs. And that's the fact that's what we're going to do. I'm going to say, as I said, the beginning. What is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency, honor, respect. Treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone hasn't even chance. And I'm going to make sure you get that you haven't beginning in the last four years.</p>
<h3>[92:29] Kristen Welker</h3>
<p>All right. I want to thank you both for a very robust hour and a half. A fantastic debate. Really appreciate it. President Trump, Former Vice President Joe Biden.
