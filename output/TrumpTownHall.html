<p>an NBC News special presentation of Today With Savannah Guthrie</p>
<h3>[0:14] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Tonight Donald Trump in the arena, his first primetime network appearance since falling ill with coronavirus. I'm feeling great. I don't know about you. How is everyone? With tonight's debate canceled, the president faces are questions live, and here's from voters about their concerns in the battleground state of Florida. It's great to be back in my home state, Florida, to make my official returns to the campaign trail. With just 19 days to go, the president makes his case. My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family from NBC News Decision. 2020 President Trump Town Hall Live from the Perez Art Museum in Miami. Here's Savannah Guthrie Hi, everybody and good evening. It's good to have you with us and welcome to Miami and our Town Hall with President Donald Trump, but we want to say right off the top, this is not how things were supposed to go tonight. This was supposed to be a town hall debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, but after the president contracted Cove in, the debate commission announced it would have to be a virtual debate because of health concerns. The president then said he would not participate in a virtual debate that point. Joe Biden scheduled a town hall tonight in Pennsylvania on another network, and now the president is doing the same. His own town hall with the same venue format in time is NBC's Town Hall with Joe Biden last week. So Theo two candidates go head to head tonight, though not face to face each in a key battleground state. And tonight the president will be taking questions from voters here in Miami. We should mention, are socially distance and they're wearing mask. And I should say, this audience looks a bit like America that's divided. Some here voted for the president in 2016 and plan to again some support Joe Biden and some say they are truly undecided. We're gonna get a mix of questions on a range of topics, and we're gonna get to those questions in a moment. But first, with all that I do welcome, Mr President, and thank you for being here</p>
<h3>[2:11] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>very well stated. I have to say Good job.</p>
<h3>[2:14] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Thank you. We're glad you're here. We're glad you're well. We send our best to the first lady into Baron. Thank you. Do you have any remaining symptoms from Covic?</p>
<h3>[2:22] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Nothing whatsoever. I'm great. I feel good. Uh was in North Carolina today and did a big rally with tremendous turnout. And I just feel really good. Florida, Pennsylvania were all over the place. It's been great.</p>
<h3>[2:35] Susan Page</h3>
<p>You receive some treatments that are generally reserved for those with the most severe form of the disease. How severe? Where your symptoms in particular did you have pneumonia?</p>
<h3>[2:46] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Well, I'll tell you what happened. Uh, I didn't feel good. I didn't feel strong. I had a little bit of a temperature. The doctors at the White House of fantastic as you could imagine, and they really didn't want to take a chance. And they said, Let's go to the hospital. I said, That's okay. I'm gonna read, you know, respond to what you say on. We went over the wall to read where you have tremendous professionals. They gave me Regeneron and, um, de severe both, and I just all I know is I felt good the following day. I felt really good.</p>
<h3>[3:14] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Did the doctors ever tell you that they saw pneumonia on your lungs. But</p>
<h3>[3:18] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>they said the lungs air, you know, a little bit different? A little bit, uh, perhaps infected on, uh, infected with e Don't know. I mean, I didn't do too much asking. I really felt good. I didn't have much of a problem with the lungs. I did have a little bit of a temperature. Obviously, I felt there was something missing. And then I tested. You know, I tested possible</p>
<h3>[3:39] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Let's talk about testing because there's a little bit of it. My guest confusion about this, and I think we can clear it up. Your first positive test was Thursday. October 1st. Okay. When was your last negative test? When did you last remember having a negative test?</p>
<h3>[3:56] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Well, I test quite a bit. And I can tell you that before the debate, which I thought it was a very good debate and I felt fantastically I was I had no problem before.</p>
<h3>[4:06] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Did you test the debate?</p>
<h3>[4:08] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I don't know. I don't even remember. I test all the time. But I could tell you this after the debate. Like I guess a day or so. E think was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening. I tested positive. That's when I first found out</p>
<h3>[4:22] Susan Page</h3>
<p>back to the debate because the debate Commission's rules it was the honor system. Be that you would come with the negative test. You say you don't know if you got a test on the day of the debate.</p>
<h3>[4:31] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>No problem again. The doctors do it. I don't ask him. I test all the time. And did</p>
<h3>[4:36] Susan Page</h3>
<p>you take a test on the day that</p>
<h3>[4:37] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>you ask the doctor to give you a perfect answer? They take a test and I leave and I go</p>
<h3>[4:42] Susan Page</h3>
<p>about Did you take a test on the day of the debate? I guess about</p>
<h3>[4:45] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>probably did. And I took a test the day before and the day before, and I was always in great shape, and I was in great shape for the debate. And it was only after the debate, like a period of time after the debate that I said, That's interesting. And they took a tested and tested plus.</p>
<h3>[5:01] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Just button it up. Do you take a test every single day?</p>
<h3>[5:04] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>No. No, but I take a lot of tests,</p>
<h3>[5:06] Susan Page</h3>
<p>okay? And you don't know if you took a test the day of</p>
<h3>[5:08] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>the debate. Uh, possibly I did possibly it in. But you know, the doctor is very accurate information on. And it's not only that, doctor, it's many doctors. The one thing as your your president, you have a lot of doctors you're surrounded by. But I was in great shape for the debate, and some time after the debate I tested positive. Let's talk about that's when they decided to Let's go.</p>
<h3>[5:29] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Okay, good, hopefully provided some clarity for folks. Let's talk about the event that was held at the White House on the Saturday before you tested positive. Subsequent to that, 13 people connected to that event tested positive. There was an outdoor reception. You've seen the pictures? There was an indoor reception. People were not wearing masks. My question to you is at this point in the pandemic, knowing what we know, shouldn't you have known better? Shouldn't the White House know better than to hold an event like Well,</p>
<h3>[5:58] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>they do a lot of testing in the White House. They test everybody including me, but they test everybody and something happened. But as far as the mask is concerned, I'm good with Master. I'm okay with mass I tell people wear masks. But just the other day they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it. So that's what I heard. And that's what I saw. And regardless, but everybody's tested and they tested often. And I also knew that I'm president. I have to see people. I can't be in a basement. I can't be in a room. I can't be. I have to be</p>
<h3>[6:34] Susan Page</h3>
<p>out e so right</p>
<h3>[6:36] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I can. But people with masks are catching it all the time. I mean, if you look at the governor of Virginia, he was known for a mask. If you look at Tom, tell us a great guy. He always had a mask and they caught it.</p>
<h3>[6:47] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Well, there are pictures of Thom Tillis actually with one of Judge Barrett's kids not wearing a mask. But you know Chris Christie, he was part of your debate press. He was, I believe in that event. He came out tonight. He was very sick. He was in the hospital for about a week. Hey, came out tonight and said I was wrong not to wear a mask.</p>
<h3>[7:04] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Well, I mean he has to say that. I think it's great. He's a friend of mine. He's a good guy. And, uh, wrong or not wrong. You have to understand, Aziz. President, I can't be locked in a room someplace for the next year and just say and do nothing. And every time I go into a crowd, I was with the parents of our fallen heroes. These people are the most incredible people. And they came up to me and they would hug me and they would touch me. And I'm not going to not let them do</p>
<h3>[7:33] Susan Page</h3>
<p>it. There was an event with the Gold Star E after the Supreme Court star</p>
<h3>[7:38] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>event with the most incredible people you've ever seen. And I could have chosen not to talk to him or to keep everybody away. And you know what? I don't think that's probably where it was thought. Maybe</p>
<h3>[7:50] Susan Page</h3>
<p>what I'm saying you bring it up. You brought it up yourself. I mean, are you trying to suggest that do you believe in grieving military family gave you Kobe? No, I don't</p>
<h3>[7:57] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>know where it came from. You don't know where it came from. And the doctors don't know where it came from. But as the president, I have to be out there. I also know</p>
<h3>[8:04] Susan Page</h3>
<p>there's no one that says You can't be out there But it's just about wearing masks and having, for example, your your e.</p>
<h3>[8:11] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Let's see Kamala. She's got people now. The people have it and I'm not blaming her. I'm not saying no. She did a terrible thing, Aziz. President, I have to be out there. I can't be in a basement. I can't be locked in a very beautiful room someplace in the White House. And I want to see the Gold Star families and I wanna see everybody. And I also say the people all the time. It's risky doing it. It is risky</p>
<h3>[8:33] Susan Page</h3>
<p>doing You're right, you don't wanna you wanna be a leader. But you also are a leader in the center of an example. And if you're not wearing a mask when your administration is saying best practice right now is where a mask No, it's not foolproof will. Unfortunately,</p>
<h3>[8:48] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>many people are getting this disease that was sent to us by China, and it shouldn't have been allowed to happen. But many people are getting this and I mean, nobody is being blamed. Everybody is working hard to get this thing out of our country. Get it out of the world. Look at what's going on in Europe. Massive spikes. They've done a very good job. But now you take a look. Today at the U. K. You take a look at Spain and France and Italy. There's tremendous spikes</p>
<h3>[9:12] Susan Page</h3>
<p>that our death rate is worse than will, not Spain. But I have</p>
<h3>[9:16] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>things right here that will tell you exactly the opposite to the UK is up 2500%. Because I knew you would be doing this. I know you very well, Theo UK is up, 2500% use up 722% and the United States is down 21%.</p>
<h3>[9:33] Susan Page</h3>
<p>So we have our deaths. Per capita is among the highest policy. Desperately</p>
<h3>[9:39] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>excess mortality were a winner on the excess mortality. And what we've done has been amazing. And we have done an amazing job and it's rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming and we have the therapies coming on. I'll tell you what one thing when I got it, e had a choice. Do nothing or use some of the things that we're looking at. Like in this case, Regeneron and Eli Lilly make something that's supposed to be incredible on, and I think that maybe I wouldn't be doing this discussion with you right now. Way have therapies now and cures. Maybe you can use the word cure, but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible.</p>
<h3>[10:17] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I wanna pick up on something you just said. You said we're rounding the corner.</p>
<h3>[10:20] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I believe surrounding the court</p>
<h3>[10:21] Susan Page</h3>
<p>10% of the country approximately has had covert. That means 80 90% 90%. Let's do the math is still vulnerable, right? There's been some talk, including from the White House lately that perhaps it approves of what's called herd immunity. That's where you basically just let young people and everybody gets sick. You try to protect the old people and those who are sick, and hopefully it gets up to a certain level and now we're all immune. So let's just be clear about it. It also means more deaths. Do you support herd immunity as a strategy? Essentially, just let people get</p>
<h3>[10:56] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>cure cannot be worse than the problem itself way did the right thing way were expected to lose 2,200,000 people. And maybe more than that, we're at 210,000 people. One person is too much. It should have never happened because of China. It happened because of China on. You have to get that and I understand that. But it shouldn't have happened. Way were expected to lose if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,000.</p>
<h3>[11:27] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Two million. Figure, though, is if you listen to people through two million. Figure is if you did absolutely nothing, it would be two million. Question is, should the should the deaths be better than 200,000 when for the rest of the way Death? Three.</p>
<h3>[11:42] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I left North Carolina, which I love. I left Pennsylvania way. Want a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lock down where nobody but her husband could do anything. He can go boating and do whatever he wants, but nobody else can. The fact is, we're winning all these cases because it's unconstitutional, what they're doing, and I think they're doing it for political reasons. But the fact is, the cure. You can't You can't let this continue to go on with the lockdowns.</p>
<h3>[12:09] Susan Page</h3>
<p>But I believe</p>
<h3>[12:10] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>that on November 4th you can have a lot of these governors look at what's happening to New York. New York is a mess. They lost almost 40,000 people. They have a lock down like you've never seen. Now they're open fucking ghost down people s. So that is very important. People are leaving New York by the thousands, and you could have a hard time ever building it up again. So that cure that so called cure that you talk about it can't be worse than the problem. The problem is a bad problem.</p>
<h3>[12:41] Susan Page</h3>
<p>We've got more questions on covert, so let's drop it for now. We were supposed to, as mentioned, watching you on a debate stage. Right now we're not doing that. So let's clear up a few things from the last one. You were asked point blank to denounce white supremacy in the moment. You didn't. You ask him. Follow up questions who specifically, a couple of days later, on a different show, you denounce white supremacy. You've done this everybody. I</p>
<h3>[13:07] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>denounce white supremacy. Okay, you know, white supremacy for years. But you always do it. You always start off with the question. You didn't ask Joe Biden whether or not he denounces Antifa. I watched him on the same basic show with Lester Holt on. He was asking questions like Biden was a child. What zone? You listening? I didn't answer white supremacy. What's your next question?</p>
<h3>[13:32] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Do you feel it? Feels sometimes you're hesitant to do so like way</p>
<h3>[13:36] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>go again every time. In fact, people came. I'm sure they'll ask you the white supremacy question I denounce white supremacy on. Frankly, you wanna know something? I denounce Antifa, and I denounce these people on the left that are burning down our cities that are run by Democrats who don't.</p>
<h3>[13:53] Susan Page</h3>
<p>While we're denouncing, let me ask you about Q. And on it is this theory that a Democrat that's our satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior of that Now can you just once and for all, state that that is completely not true about Q and on in its entirety?</p>
<h3>[14:16] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I know nothing about Q and on</p>
<h3>[14:18] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I just tried</p>
<h3>[14:18] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>very little. You told me, but what you tell me doesn't necessarily make it fact. I hate to say that I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard, but I</p>
<h3>[14:32] Susan Page</h3>
<p>know nothing. Believe it. If you like a</p>
<h3>[14:35] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>study subjects, I'll tell you what I do know about. I know about Antifa and I know about the radical left and I know how island they are and how vicious they are on. I know how they're burning down cities run by Democrats,</p>
<h3>[14:47] Susan Page</h3>
<p>not Republican Senator Ben Sasse said. Quote que Annan is nuts and really leaders call conspiracy theories. Conspiracy theory may. Why not just say it's crazy and not true? He</p>
<h3>[14:58] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>may be right. I just don't know about Q. And on</p>
<h3>[15:01] Susan Page</h3>
<p>You do know.</p>
<h3>[15:02] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I don't know. No, I don't know. E Don't know. Waste the whole show. You start off with white supremacy, denounce it. You start off with something else. Let's go. Keep asking me these questions</p>
<h3>[15:15] Susan Page</h3>
<p>way. Let me just</p>
<h3>[15:17] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>let me just tell you what I do hear about it is they are very strongly against pedophilia, and I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that. And I agree</p>
<h3>[15:25] Susan Page</h3>
<p>with the way you know that, Okay? No, I don't know. You just do you know that? Just you</p>
<h3>[15:35] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>asking me about Antifa? Why aren't you asking you? What you asking Joe Biden questions about? Why doesn't he condemn Antifa? Why does he say it doesn't exist?</p>
<h3>[15:47] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Because your teeth</p>
<h3>[15:48] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>no s so cute. Antifa exists there, vicious. They're violent, They kill people and they're burning down our cities and they happen to be radical left.</p>
<h3>[15:59] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Just this week, you retweeted to your 87 million followers. A conspiracy theory that Joe Biden orchestrated to have seal Team six, the Navy seal to six killed to cover up the fake death of bin Laden. Now, why would you send a lot like you re tweet? It was</p>
<h3>[16:15] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>a retweet. That was a opinion of somebody on That was a retweet. I'll put it out there. People can</p>
<h3>[16:22] Susan Page</h3>
<p>decide with your like someone's crazy uncle who retweet whatever</p>
<h3>[16:27] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>That was a retweet. And I do a lot of retweets. And frankly, because the media is so faith and so corrupt. If I didn't have social media, I don't call it Twitter. I call it Social Media. I wouldn't be able to get the word out and the</p>
<h3>[16:41] Susan Page</h3>
<p>word you know what</p>
<h3>[16:42] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>the word is? The word is very simple. We're building our country stronger and better than it's ever been before. That's what's happening and everybody knows it. You know what the word is winning in a lot of states, winning in a lot of states.</p>
<h3>[16:55] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Yeah, that the election. Because I do want to ask about that. That's another kind of leftover item. A lot of people have asked you, Will you accept a peaceful transfer of power? You have said repeatedly the Onley way we lose this election is if it is rigged. Now that is simply not true. The fact is, either candidate can lose fair and square without ballot fry when you accept the way</p>
<h3>[17:19] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I wanted to pay. But when I see thousands of balance right unsolicited ballots being given out by the millions and thousands of them are dumped in dumpsters and when you see balance with the name Trump military ballots from our great military and they dumped in garbage</p>
<h3>[17:37] Susan Page</h3>
<p>cans hand, we could go all night which we want way one by one, a single case of single there. You're talking about 150 million votes. Your own FBI director says there is no evidence of widespread. Well,</p>
<h3>[17:50] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>then he's not doing a very good job. All you have to do is pick up the papers every day. 50,000 in Ohio, The great state of Ohio. 50,000, Uh, in another location. I think North Carolina. 500,000 applications in Virginia. No, no, there's a tremendous problem. But let me just tell you. They talk about the peaceful transfer, right? They spied on my campaign and they got caught and they spied heavily on my campaign, and they tried to take down a duly elected city president. And then they talk about Will you accept a peaceful transfer? And the answer is Yes, I will. But I wanted to be an honest election, and so does everybody else. When I see thousands of ballots dumped in a garbage can and they happened to have my name on it, I'm not happy</p>
<h3>[18:35] Susan Page</h3>
<p>about just those are case. There is no There is in fact, no evidence of widespread fraud. And you were sowing doubt about our democracy, our democracy. How can</p>
<h3>[18:45] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>you say that? You do read Newspapers do watch the news. You watch it ideo Because every day they're talking about ballots that are corrupt, that are fraudulent</p>
<h3>[18:56] Susan Page</h3>
<p>and millions that are being processed right now. But you can win</p>
<h3>[19:00] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>a race. Take a look at me. You can win a race by 1%.</p>
<h3>[19:03] Susan Page</h3>
<p>So why are you laying the groundwork for that right now? It's like e with my husband and I say my ankles e don't</p>
<h3>[19:10] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>want that to happen. Savannah e wanted to be clean. I really feel we're gonna win. But I want this to be clean. But it's sort of ironic that you and them talk about the peaceful transfer when I spent 3.5 years fighting off these maniacs and now it turns out everything's there that they were the ones that dealt with Russia on It's too bad a peaceful transfer. I absolutely want that. But ideally, I don't want to transfer because I wanna win.</p>
<h3>[19:38] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Yeah, and I think that your words will probably reassure some folks. Let's get to our first voter. We've got Jacqueline luego now. She is. I told you this This audience is truly split between. You are leaning. Biden she voted for Clinton in 2016. She's registered is an independent. Jacqueline. What's your question for the president? And you hold the mic up close and take up your mike is the target here. Out here. Good evening. Welcome to Miami. Thank you. Beautiful. Mr. President, if you knew Kobe 19 as you told Bob Woodward in February, Askew told Bob Woodward in February, was airborne and deadlier than the flu. Why did you on Lee, put in place a travel ban from China and not put in place other measures mitigating the spread of covert 19 potentially saving tens of thousands of American lives?</p>
<h3>[20:34] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Well, I did put it in very early. As you know, Joe Biden was two months behind me and he called me xenophobic and racist and everything else because I put it in and it turned out that I was 100% right. I also put it on Europe very early because I saw there was a lot of infection in Europe, and it's sort of an amazing question, and I appreciate the question and respect the question, but the news doesn't get out the right answer because I put on the travel ban far earlier than Dr Fauci thought it was necessary. Who I like far earlier that the scientists I was actually the only one that wanted to put it on. And I did it actually, against the advice of a lot of people, including Nancy Pelosi, who had no clue what she was doing. And Biden. When I put on the travel ban and I put it on in January, the end of January when I put on the travel ban, Joe Biden and others said, This is ridiculous. You don't do that. Well, Dr Fauci said. I saved thousands and thousands of lives. I was early. I was extremely early when I put on the travel. But</p>
<h3>[21:34] Susan Page</h3>
<p>can I ask you, Did your national security advisor on January 28th in the Oval Office warn you that this would be the greatest National Security Administration? E read</p>
<h3>[21:45] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>it someplace. Maybe Woodward said it or something, But no, he did not say that, but I knew it was a big threat At the same time. I don't wanna panic this country. I don't want to go out and say</p>
<h3>[21:56] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Everybody's going to die, everybody E</p>
<h3>[22:01] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>no, there's not a good You have to be safe. You have to be vigilant. And you have to be smart.</p>
<h3>[22:05] Susan Page</h3>
<p>You're gonna like this. Next couple of voters and mom and a daughter. Mom, Barbara voted for you in 2016. She's leaning to vote for you again. Now, her daughter was too young to vote last time. She's gonna vote for her first time in a presidential campaign and she is leaning. Biden. So imagine the dinner table at their house. Okay, So, Barbara, like, why don't you go first and ask your question? Bienvenido Miami Thank you, Mr Trump. As a front line er doctor working through the coronavirus pandemic. I know firsthand, and I've seen that many hospitals throughout the United States are suffering financial hardships. Thes economic effects are trickling down to the front line workers wear being across the country. Frontline workers were being fired to being furloughed. Our salaries were being cut. And this is also happening another economic sectors as well, including the travel industry and hospitality. My question to you is, how are you going to get the United States back on track both in terms of the economy and the pandemic.</p>
<h3>[23:03] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>So it's happening. We just set a record 11.4 million jobs way. We're gonna have a phenomenal third quarter, which will be announced on November 1st, just prior to the big November 3rd day we're thinking this year, Red Wave, but we're gonna have a tremendous announcement, I believe. I mean, we're gonna find out, but GDP is going through the roof jobs, Uh, real estate houses. So many things are happening. So people were saying we're gonna have a 42% unemployment. Look, this'll was a thing that came into our country, and it happened 100 more than 100 years ago, and it happened. Now they were talking about a 42% unemployment</p>
<h3>[23:42] Susan Page</h3>
<p>rate about. I just came out</p>
<h3>[23:45] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>at 7.8% unemployment, and people can't even believe it. Our economy is going to be next year if we don't have somebody that raises taxes and quadruples taxes, which they want to do and kills everything. Our economy is going to be phenomenal. Next year, we're gonna have a phenomenal and I'll tell you, Savannah, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country last year, including the state of Florida, where we are now in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Every place we have the greatest economy we ever had way had a close it down. We saved two million lives. We're opening it up. We have a V shape and it's coming back. It's coming back very fast. One other thing. We really helped the hospitals. We've said billions and billions of dollars to the hospitals. In addition, hundreds of millions of masks and gowns and we went into the ventilator business because this country was not equipped with ventilators, and I'm not blaming anybody for it. But we're now making thousands of ventilators a month, and we have all we can use. We're sending them all over the world because the world needs them. So they've worked very hard and really very, very effectively. Thank you. Great question.</p>
<h3>[24:53] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Let's talk to Isabella, but close to your mouth. Okay, go ahead. Mr President. My parents are, as you heard, both frontline healthcare workers and I have seen the physical and the mental tools that this pandemic has taken on them firsthand, as well as the exacerbation of coronavirus due to Americans who are not wearing masks or participating in social distancing after contracting Kobe 19 yourself. Has your opinion changed on the importance of mask wearing?</p>

<p>No, because I was okay with the masks. I was good with it, but I've heard many different stories on masks. I mean, I had, you know, being president, you have people, they bring meals, they bring this on. And I had an instance recently where a very wonderful person is bringing me a meal. And he's playing with his mask and he's touching his mask all over the place. And then he's bringing a plate in. And I'm saying, Well, I don't know if that's so good. I mean, the good news. I didn't need it. Okay? I did. I decided not to you that this was a month ago, but I Look, look, you have on the masks. You know you have two stories.

Thank you for your service, Mr</p>
<h3>[30:43] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>President. Thank you very much.</p>
<h3>[30:45] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Were hard working middle class family for my husband and I are both self employed and we have to get our own individual health care. As you know, health care costs have gone up considerably over the decades. And you had originally said you were going to repeal and replace Obama care. What is your plan now in 2020 to make health care costs affordable for Americans like myself.</p>
<h3>[31:08] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>So we got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obama care. And now you could actually say it's not Obama care because that's how big it was, where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. So we got rid of that. That was a big, big thing and by doing that and we will always have by way, we're always protecting people with pre existing conditions and I can't say that more strongly. But we've been able to bring health care costs way down now. I took over Obamacare got rid of the individual mandate, made it good management much better. Remember they had the $5 billion website disaster and all of the problems they had a problem with Obamacare. It's not good. We'd like to terminate it and we want a much less expensive healthcare. That's a much better health care and that's where we're aiming and if we could do that and we have a very good chance of doing it. But we've also brought down the price of Obama care from with Obamacare. It basically is never going to be great. And I want to give great health care.</p>
<h3>[32:13] Susan Page</h3>
<p>This is a pre existing conditions. This is such a big issue for voters.</p>
<h3>[32:18] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>It is a big issue for me</p>
<h3>[32:19] Susan Page</h3>
<p>to in point of fact, your administration is about to go to the Supreme Court, argue to throw out the rest of Obama care, which includes the protections for pre existing conditions. So your administration is in court right now trying to get rid of that protection</p>
<h3>[32:32] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>in order to replace it with a much better health care at a much lower price. And always, under all circumstances, we're going to protect the Republicans. And I mean, maybe I changed the party a lot over the last three years, but we will protect people with preexisting conditions in Savannah. What? I wanna dio get rid of the terrible obamacare. I've already done it to a large extent because, as you know, that the individual mandate is gone. That was the worst</p>
<h3>[33:00] Susan Page</h3>
<p>for people. But you haven't replaced Now. You've been in office almost four years. You have both houses of Congress, Senate in house, in Republican hands. There is not a replacement. Yes,</p>
<h3>[33:11] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>that's right. I'm sorry, but if you look, we had both houses and what do we do? We got rid of the individual mandate way should be on the same side. I wanted very simple. I'm gonna put it very simple. Way would like to terminate it, and we would like to replace it with something that's much less expensive and much better way will always protect people with preexisting</p>
<h3>[33:32] Susan Page</h3>
<p>conditions. That way in November, those pre existing conditions with way</p>
<h3>[33:38] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>if we don't succeed way, are running the remnants of whatever is left because we took it apart. Wear running the remnants of whatever is left much better than the previous administration, which ran it very badly. But we'd like to have new health care much better and much less expensive. Let</p>
<h3>[33:55] Susan Page</h3>
<p>me get to question number five, and you'll like this. He's stuck in traffic. His name is Joe White. He is registered as a Democrat. He says he's leaning toward vitamin and Biden and voted for Hillary Clinton, 2016 and his question was, a second stimulus payment has been broadly agreed upon by the Republicans and Democrats. And yet now we're in October, and it's still not past. Why not use your office to make the second stimulus payment a separate targeted emergency relief package to help Americans, whether the panda</p>
<h3>[34:22] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>actually passed three packages. But when we're on our fourth and I agree with him 100% he should vote for me. The problem you have is Nancy Pelosi. She couldn't care less about the worker. She couldn't care less about our people, and we should have a stimulus and I want a stimulus. The Republicans will approve a stimulus. The problem is, she doesn't want to do it because she thinks thinks it's bad for her election. The fact is, she is wrong because people know she's in our way. She's not approving it. She doesn't appreciate our people and she doesn't approve. Appreciate it all. Our workers. Nancy Pelosi. We are ready to sign and pass stimulus, but she's</p>
<h3>[34:59] Susan Page</h3>
<p>gonna do not love the back and forth of Washington. But this has been a roller coaster. Back in early October, you one day tweeted. No more negotiations until election until after Election day. I'm walking away. Then I think the next couple of days you said maybe we could do something targeted. Then you said I want a big big bill. But then Senate Republicans said, No, we're not for that. So you are the big deal maker. How come this is so you yourself have changed positions.</p>
<h3>[35:27] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Did you ever hear of word called negotiation when negotiating? Okay, but</p>
<h3>[35:33] Susan Page</h3>
<p>people are negotiating lives, air hanging</p>
<h3>[35:35] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>in the balance. And you know, I'm negotiating against Nancy Pelosi because she doesn't want to give the money. Way should have stimulus. This'll was not our people's fault. This was China's fault, and she's penalizing are people I'm ready to sign a big, beautiful stimulus you saw the other day. I say go big or go home, right? That's what I wanted to be big. I wanted to be bold. I want the money go to</p>
<h3>[35:56] Susan Page</h3>
<p>directly Republicans with you. They're gonna go big, big number.</p>
<h3>[36:00] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>They're gonna be</p>
<h3>[36:01] Susan Page</h3>
<p>So far, they have not</p>
<h3>[36:03] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>because I haven't asked him to because I can't get through Nancy Pelosi. If Nancy Pelosi and I threw my representatives or directly, I don't care if we agree to something, the Republicans will agree to it.</p>
<h3>[36:15] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Okay, Our next question comes from this is interesting. She voted for Clinton in 2016 but recently changed her registration from Democrat to independent. She says she's truly undecided. Her name's Becky Lightman. Hello, Becky. What's your question? How are you? I'm great. How are you?</p>
<h3>[36:31] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Nice to see you. Good to</p>
<h3>[36:32] Susan Page</h3>
<p>see you. So corporate tax rates are hot button issue and you have cut corporate tax rates. And your opponent, Joe Biden, is planning to raise them. Ah, lot of Americans think that corporations don't pay their share of taxes and want to see those tax rates increase. Yeah, what do you say to those Americans To maybe tell them why you want</p>
<h3>[36:54] undefined</h3>
<p>the corporate tax rate lower and why that</p>
<h3>[36:57] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>it's a great question. We've created more jobs than this country has ever created Were up to 160 million jobs. We were never even close to that number. Way were just hitting. 160 million jobs. Companies are pouring into our nation because of the tax rate. And if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do, you will blow this thing and you'll end up with the Depression, the likes of which you've never had. That's what's going to happen way have something that's really good. The reason we're coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation. Companies air moving in car companies are moving into Michigan into Ohio into South Carolina and North Carolina just today. So what's happening is they're coming in because we reduced the taxes are taxes are corporate taxes were the highest in the world, and now they're among the lower taxes. They're not the lowest, but they're among the lowest and what that means his jobs. But also, we're doing a very big and we've done a very big middle income tax package. So we get in, we're gonna do the middle income tax package. But it's a great question. And if he comes along and raises rates, all those companies that are coming in they will leave the US so fast your head will spin. We can't let that happen on</p>
<h3>[38:12] Susan Page</h3>
<p>the subject of taxes. As you know, the New York Times has obtained. It says years of your tax returns. Among other things, it says that you have debts of approximately $421 million that you have personally guaranteed, and that will come due in the next four years. Question is, on behalf of voters who do you owe 421 million</p>
<h3>[38:31] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>dollars to? What they did is illegal. Number one. Also, the numbers were all wrong with the numbers they release. And just so you understand, when you have a lot of real estate, have real estate, do you know a lot of it? Okay, right down the road, Darryl. Big stuff, great stuff. I'm very under. When I decided to run, I'm very under livered, Fortunately, but I'm very under leverage. I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared in fact, some of it. I did his favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money. $400 million compared to the assets that I have all of these great properties all over the world. And frankly, Bank of America building in San Francisco E don't love what's happening to San Francisco.</p>
<h3>[39:15] Susan Page</h3>
<p>You $400 million isn't that big office buildings? But are you? Are you Are you confirming that? Yes, you dio some $400 million saying</p>
<h3>[39:25] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>is that it's a tiny percentage of my net worth</p>
<h3>[39:29] Susan Page</h3>
<p>that you see</p>
<h3>[39:30] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>that soon? Because we're doing things, you know we've given. I think it's 108 or 112 pages of financial details to elections. And, you know, we have to file a Z the president, as any politician you have to file. Nobody ever looks at that. When they do, they see how incredible a company is. But more importantly, they see where this that is. No, I don't know. Russia money. I don't know. I have a very, very small It's called mortgages. People have a house.</p>
<h3>[39:58] Susan Page</h3>
<p>More Bank E.</p>
<h3>[40:00] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>No, but I will, probably because it's so easy to solve. And if you'd like to do, I will let you know who who I owe. Whatever small amount of money I want to say. Two things. Number one. It's a very small amount of money. Number two. It's very straight. It's very, very straight, but it's a tiny percentage of the worth. Did you ever hear the expression under livered? I'm extremely under level.</p>
<h3>[40:24] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Here's the thing. You could clear this up tonight by just releasing your tax returns yourself. I mean, that's what e. I think people are just what you're the only</p>
<h3>[40:31] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>It turned out that I am.</p>
<h3>[40:33] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I wrote it. Actually. Excuse me. No, no, but that doesn't stop releases</p>
<h3>[40:38] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>of not being under audit previously. And another people that NBC and I am under audit. So that was solved. That's what I am under it. No person in their right mind would release prior to working out the deal with the IRS and I'll go a step further. I'm treated very badly by the I. R. S. They treat me very, very badly. You have people in there from previous administrations. They treat me very badly, But we're under audit. It's very routine in many ways, but we're under audit. They like to change the game, change the rules to everything You saw, what they did with the tea party people. You saw what they did with the religious</p>
<h3>[41:13] Susan Page</h3>
<p>clear. There is no law or rule that prohibits you from releasing your tax common</p>
<h3>[41:19] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>sense and intelligence and having lawyers would say because I would love to release him. Ondas. Soon as we come to a conclusion, I will release him and very gladly. But if you go to elections and if you take a look, you'll see 112. I think it's 112. It talks about the income, which is rather massive. It talks about all of the properties. They have them listed. You can never learn more. But you know what happened? People went there. All the reporters went. There was like a feeding frenzy. This was originally when I filed it, and I found it Every year I updated every year. My son is here. They run the company. I don't run. The company</p>
<h3>[41:55] Susan Page</h3>
<p>also says that e dollars in taxes in the year you were elected</p>
<h3>[42:00] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>a statutory number. It's a statutory e think it's a filing number. You pay 750. It's a</p>
<h3>[42:06] Susan Page</h3>
<p>filing. E. Most people here probably know.</p>
<h3>[42:09] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I don't know. I could tell you this if they have my tax returns, as you know, they have to go to jail. It's illegal, but their numbers were wrong. But let me tell you what else I don't know. Money to any of these sinister people has been going on for years now. Russia, Russia, Russia turned out to be a hoax on it turned out to be that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were dealing with Russia, not may. It's the whole hoax, so I would not mind it all saying who it is. But it's a very small when you look at vast properties like I have and they're big and they're beautiful and they're well located. When you look at that three amount of money, $400 million is a peanut. It's extremely under livered, and it's leveled with normal banks, Not a big deal.</p>

<h3>[46:52] undefined</h3>
<p>Thank you, Savannah. Thank you, Mr President. Four years ago, Senate leadership said it was inappropriate to push through a nominee in an election year. Yet they fast tracked your nominee for the Supreme Court Just today. Uh, question I have for you is how do you What do you say to the voter that thinks it's hypocritical to act in that manner and that they can't trust Republicans word.</p>
<h3>[47:14] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>So when I was elected and when the president is elected, they're elected for a period of four years, and Justice Ginsburg said it best. I think talking about President Obama having to do with somebody else that the president has put there for four years, not for three years. So during this fourth year, it happened to come up unfortunately, because I have great respect for Justice Ginsburg. But a vacancy happened to come up and we pick somebody that's outstanding. She has been an absolute star, and I'm extremely proud of it, But again, plenty of time. I mean, there's plenty of time we're gonna do before the election, but we also have much time after the election. But there's no reason to wait because it's almost unanimous. It seems to me, certainly within the Republican Party and frankly, most of the Democrats within closed rooms, I guarantee you that Thistle is an outstanding person and I'm using my fourth term. And you know, if you look at it and if you put the shoe on the other foot, if they had this, they would do it 100%. So there's been 29 times when this has happened all 29 times. A president has done exactly what I've done</p>
<h3>[48:21] Susan Page</h3>
<p>e to the voters point. I'll just say that in 2016 you were on another show, actually another morning show, and you were asked whether President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court justice, Merrick Garland. And you said, I think the Senate should wait until the next president and let the president picked now. That was eight months before the election. This is three weeks before a</p>
<h3>[48:42] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>lot of respect. By the</p>
<h3>[48:43] Susan Page</h3>
<p>way, you have changed your position on this.</p>
<h3>[48:45] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I have a lot of respect for Judge Garland. I want to tell you that. But I'll tell you, the whole ballgame changed when I saw the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh. I have never seen any human being. And I'm not just talking about Supreme Court. I have never seen a human being treated so badly with false accusations and everything else. E I have never seen anything like it. And you know what? The truth is, Savannah. Like it or not, the ballgame changed a lot. There has never been anybody treated so badly as now. Justice Kavanaugh,</p>
<h3>[49:16] Susan Page</h3>
<p>you've mentioned that you would like to see Amy Coney Barrett confirmed to the Supreme Court in case any challenges come up in connection with the election. Do you expect her to rule for you?</p>
<h3>[49:28] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>E think she'll have to make that decision? I don't think she has any conflict at all. You know, a Supreme Court judge does not have. I mean, they can make their own decision. Uh, the they actually have additional power to make that decision. Uh, it would be totally up to her. E. I would think that she would be able to rule either for me or against me, but I don't see any conflict whatsoever. way have an election coming up. I think it's the most imp important election in the history of our country if for any chance that it probably won't and I hope it doesn't ever get to the Supreme Court. But if it did, I would think that she would rule one way or the other. I would think so. But</p>
<h3>[50:04] Susan Page</h3>
<p>for you, you think she would rule for you?</p>
<h3>[50:06] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I have no idea. I</p>
<h3>[50:07] Susan Page</h3>
<p>mean, of course, rule one way or the other. But</p>
<h3>[50:09] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>believe it or not, I never asked her about it. I never talked about it. I didn't talk about any of the obvious things that you could talk about, and I think a lot of people in my position might. But in speaking to a lot of very brilliant people and people that do this for a living, they say it's better not to talk. So I talked to her about life. I talked to her about the fact Would you like to do this? Are you willing to do this because it's a tremendous burden? Thea answer was yes, she is unbelievably well qualified, but I never spoke to about these various questions.</p>

<p>Well, again, I'm not ruling in this. And Roe v. Wade is something that a lot of people say. Obviously, you're going to speak to somebody. I also to other great justices, Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh. I never spoke to them about Roe v. Wade. I never spoke to them about election laws. I never spoke to him about anything on. I've done the right thing from a moral standpoint, I don't even know from a legal standpoint, but it was the right thing. Uh, I think depending on what happens with Roe v Wade, I think that perhaps it could get sent down to the states and the states would decide. I also think perhaps nothing will happen. Uh, I have not talked to her about it. I think it would be inappropriate to talk to about it, and some people would say You can talk to about it. I just think would be inappropriate.</p>
<h3>[52:01] Susan Page</h3>
<p>But what is your preference? Because it agreed. That's not something you should talk to the judge about. What would you like to see Roe versus Wade overturned?</p>
<h3>[52:08] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>I would. I would like to see a brilliant jurist, a brilliant person who has done this, uh, in great depth and has actually skirted this issue for a long time. Make a decision, and that's why I chose her. E think that she's going to make a great decision. I did not tell her what decision to make, and I think would be inappropriate to say right now because I don't wanna do anything to influence her. I want her to get approved and then I want her to go by the law, and I know she's gonna make a great decision for our country. Along</p>
<h3>[52:41] Susan Page</h3>
<p>with Republican, most pro life Republicans would like to see Roe v Wade overturned and abortion banned,</p>
<h3>[52:47] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>many of them would. Most of them would. I am telling you, I don't wanna do anything to influence anything right now. I don't wanna go out tomorrow and say, Oh, he's trying to give her a signal because I didn't speak to her about it. I've done the right thing in so doing how she's going to rule, you're gonna find out, perhaps, or you might not find out. I mean, it may never get there. It may never get there. We'll see what happens.</p>
<h3>[53:10] Susan Page</h3>
<p>All right, we have another question. Thistles. Cindy Valez. She is undecided. She says she's leaning to Biden and she did vote for Clinton in 2016. She's registered as a Democrat. Hi, Cindy, With your question. Good evening.</p>
<h3>[53:22] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Good evening, Mr President. Thank you very much. A</p>

<p>a young male of color. I have reason to respect authority not only because it's the right thing to do, but</p>

<p>also out of fear that he</p>

<p>may face profiling or be considered a criminal. As an educator, I've</p>

<p>also had similar conversations with my high school students. Mr. President, what will you and your administration dio to better prepare our law enforcement officers</p>
<h3>[53:49] undefined</h3>
<p>toe work in collaboration with the communities that they serve and</p>
<h3>[53:53] Susan Page</h3>
<p>also to protect the lives of innocents, black and Latinos from police brutality and injustice.</p>
<h3>[53:58] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Right? I fully understand the question, and I saw everything that you saw over the summer, and it was a terrible thing, A terrible thing to watch way. We're very strongly we have. Ah, Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina. He came up with a bill that should have been approved. It was great. It was a bill that was strong in terms of law enforcement and strong in terms of enforcing the proper thing and doing the proper thing by law enforcement. And the Democrats just wouldn't go for it. They wouldn't go for it all. And I don't know why, because it was a really great bill. But I do have to say this, and some people don't like it when I say it. But a lot of people agree I have done more for the African American community than any president. With the exception of Abraham Lincoln, Criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically black colleges and universities. I got them funded. They were in a year to year basis, they could have been put out of business. A Sooners. Our country had a little bad year. They would have said, I'm sorry, we're not gonna fund you I got him 10 year funding and financing and more than they even asked for. I became very friendly with a lot of the heads, but we've dunmore and of course, opportunity zones. But criminal justice reform. Everybody said it could. It could not be done. President Obama and Biden never even tried to dio. They never even tried. But I say that and I say it often. I'll say it loud and I'm very proud of it. And I have a great relationship because of what I've done with the African American community. I'm very proud of it. Let's</p>
<h3>[55:28] Susan Page</h3>
<p>go to our next question. We have palette. Dale. She leans slightly to Biden. She voted for Clinton in 2016. She's registered as a Republican bullet. What's your question? Thank you. Good evening, Mr</p>
<h3>[55:38] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>President. Thank you very much.</p>
<h3>[55:39] Susan Page</h3>
<p>I have to say you have a great smile. Got you eso because you're so handsome when you smile. Aziz, daughter of immigrants to the United States who fled Eastern Europe due to religious persecution out of the United States. Immigration policies are very personal for me, right? Surveys show that most Americans and the majority of Republicans support the Dreamers program. So my question for you, Mr President, is if you are elected to a second term, do you expect to pursue your previous efforts to cut the doctor program? Why or why not?</p>
<h3>[56:31] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>And the Dhaka Dhaka is somewhat different than dreamers. You understand that and you understand it better than anybody. Probably in this room. Where do you come from, By the way? Originally,</p>
<h3>[56:40] Susan Page</h3>
<p>my grand parents were from Russia and Poland.</p>
<h3>[56:43] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>That's very good. Okay, So way are going to take care of DACA. We're going to take care of dreamer way. It's working right now. We're negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration Law Way built now over 400 miles of border wall, Southern border Mexico is working very closely with us. We have the strongest border we've ever had way want people to come into our country. They have to come in legally, but we are working very hard on the DACA program, and you will be, I think very happy over the course of the next year because I feel the same way as you do about it. Thank you, Mr. Thank you. Thank you very much,</p>
<h3>[57:21] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Mr President. Important fact. The DACA program there are under your administration. No new applicants are allowed. And in fact, the DACA recipients now have to renew every year as opposed to every two years. So, in fact, the DACA program has been well curtailed by your administration. What</p>
<h3>[57:38] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>happened is because of the pandemic much changed on the immigration front. Mexico is heavily infected, as you know, and we've made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic. On other reasons in crime. But we have a very strong border right now, and we have to keep it that way but way want people to come into our country. But they have to come in through a merit system and they have to come in legally and people are very, very happy with it. You haven't heard any complaints about that. But what happened is because of the pandemic. We have to be extra cautious.</p>
<h3>[58:10] Susan Page</h3>
<p>Have been promising this immigration bill since, well, at least July when you told my colleague Telemundo coming? Nothing. It's</p>
<h3>[58:17] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>very happy that the fact is we got rid of catch and release, which is a disaster. You know, you catch somebody that could be a murderer, that could be a rapist. We're supposed to release them into our country thes air. The laws that I inherited, we ended that program. Now I think you're gonna see something very, very good. The whole immigration If you look at what's going on, people used to pour into our country on especially during the pandemic. I think you'll be. I think even you, Savannah, will be very impressive.</p>
<h3>[58:44] Susan Page</h3>
<p>We have about 30 seconds left. I think about people sitting out there tonight. There are some who love you. Some of them are sitting right around here and some who will never vote for you. But there are people in the middle. There are people who aren't sure there are people who want to know why they should give you a second chance and how you might improve in a second term. 30 seconds. What would you say to them?</p>
<h3>[59:03] Kamala Harris</h3>
<p>Because they've done a great job. We have the strongest economy in the world. We closed it up way are coming around the corner. Vaccines in coming out soon and our economy is strong. Way are at a level with jobs like we've never been before. We've rebuilt our military. We've rebuilt our borders. We had no borders. We had no nothing. We've rebuilt so much. We've given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country. Greatest regulation cut equally is important. And we created new levels of jobs that nobody thought was possible. And next year is going to be better than ever before</p>
<h3>[59:39] Susan Page</h3>
