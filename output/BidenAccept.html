<h3>[1:55] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>with the confidence of the whole people toe win the confidence of all of you And for that is what America I believe is about. It's about people, and that's what our administration will be all about. I sought this office to restore the soul America, to rebuild the backbone of this nation, the middle class, and to make America respected around the world again to unite us here at home. It's the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision and now the work of making that vision Israel. It's a task, the task of our time folks. As I said many times before, I'm Jill's husband on. I would not be here without their love entirely support of Jill and my son, Hunter and Ashley, my daughter and all our grandchildren and their spouse is and all our family. They're in my heart, Joseph Mama, military mom and educator. She has dedicated her life to education, but t she doesn't just what she does, it's who she is. For American educators, this is a great</p>

<p>day for you all. You're gonna have one of your own in the White House on Jill's gonna make a great first lady. I'm so proud of her off, huh? The honor</p>
<h3>[3:44] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>of serving with a fantastic vice president. You just heard from Kamala Harris, who makes history as the first woman first black woman, the first woman from South Asia to say the first daughter of immigrants ever elected in this country?</p>
<h3>[4:03] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Don't tell me. Stop possible in the United States. It's low overdue, and we're reminded tonight</p>
<h3>[4:17] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>of those who fought so hard for so many years to make this happen. Once again, America's bent the arc of the moral universe. War toward justice, Comma Doug. Like it or not, your family, you're becoming honorary Biden. There's no way out. All those who you volunteered and work the polls in the Middle East pandemic. Local elected officials. You deserve a special thanks from the entire nation on my campaign team and all the volunteers on all who gave so much of themselves to make this moment possible. Iou, iou, IOU, everything and all those who supported us. I'm proud of the campaign we built ran. I'm proud of the coalition. We put together the broadest and most diverse coalition in history Democrats, Republicans, independents, progressives, moderates, conservatives, young, old, urban, suburban, rural, gay, straight, transgender, white Latino,</p>
<h3>[5:29] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Asian, Native American. I mean it, especially those moments,</p>
<h3>[5:37] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>especially for those moments for this campaign, was that his lowest ebb. The African American community stood up again for many.</p>
<h3>[5:45] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>We've always had my back and I'll have yours.</p>
<h3>[5:53] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>I said at the outset. I wanted to represent this campaign to represent and look like America. We've done that now. That's what the administration that looked like an act like for all those of you who voted for President Trump. I understand the disappointment tonight. I've lost a couple of times myself. But now let's give each other a chance. It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric, lower the temperature, see each other again, listen to each other again. And to make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as our enemies. They are not our enemies. There are Americans. They're Americans. The Bible tells us to everything. There's a season, a time to build, a time to reap it, a time to sow and a time to heal. This is the time to heal in America. Now this campaign is over. What is the will of people? What is our mandate? I believe it's this American have called upon us to marshal the forces of decency, the forces of fairness to marshal the forces of science and the forces of hope and the great battles of our time. The battle of control, the virus, the battle of build prosperity, the battle of secure your family's health care the battle. Achieve racial justice and root out systemic racism in this country. The battle to save our planet by getting climate under control the battle of restore decency, Defend democracy and give everybody in this country a fair shot. That's all they're asking for a fair shot. Yeah, folks, our work begins with getting covert under control. We cannot repair the economy, restore our vitality, a relish life's most precious moments, hugging our grandchildren, our Children, our birthdays, weddings, graduations, all the moments that matter most to us until we get it under control. On Monday, I will name a group of leading scientists and experts as transition advisors to help take Biden Harris covert plan and converted into an action blueprint that will start on January 20th 2021. That plan will be built on bedrock science will be constructed out of compassion, empathy and concern I will spare no effort, none or any commitment to turn around this pandemic. Folks, I'm a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. Our work is hard for those who didn't vote for May as those who did let this grim here of demonization in America begin to end here and now refusal of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another. It's not some mysterious force beyond our control. It's a decision, a choice we make. And if we could decide not to cooperate, then we can decide to cooperate. And I believe that this is part of the mandate given to us from the American people. They want us to cooperate in their interest, and that's the choice I'll make. And I'll call on Congress. Democrats, Republicans alike to make that choice with May, the American story is about slow yet steadily widening the opportunities in America and make no mistake, too many dreams have been deferred for too long. We must make the promise of the country, really for everybody, no matter their race, their ethnicity, their faith, their identity or the disability folks. America has always been shaped by inflection points by moments in time. We've made hard decisions about who we are and what we want to be. Lincoln in 18 60 Coming to save the Union, FDR in 1932 promising a beleaguered country. A New deal. JFK in 1960 pledging a new frontier. And 12 years ago, when Barack Obama made history, told us,</p>
<h3>[11:11] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>Yes, we can wait. We stand at an inflection point. We have an opportunity to defeat, despair, to build a nation of prosperity and purpose. We can do it. I know we can. I've long talked</p>
<h3>[11:31] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>about the battle for the soul of America. We must restore the soul of America. Our nation is shaped by the constant battle between our better angels on our darkest impulses. And what president say in this battle matters. It's time for our better angels to prevail. Tonight, the whole world is watching America, and I believe it. Our best America is a beacon for the globe. We will not leave. We will lead not only by the example of our power, but by the power of our example. I've always believed many of you heard me say I've always believed we could define America in one word possibilities that in America everyone should be given an opportunity to go asses faras their dreams and God given ability will take them. You see, I believe in the possibility of this country. We're always looking ahead ahead. 21 Americans, freer and more just had to in America that creates jobs with</p>
<h3>[12:47] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>dignity and respect. Head of America that cures diseases like caches and Alzheimer's ahead to an American that never leaves anyone behind ahead of America that never gives up. Never gives in. Thats a great nation. It's always been a bad bet to bet against America. We're good people. This is the United States, America. There's never been anything, never been anything we've been able</p>
<h3>[13:18] Joe Biden</h3>
<p>not able to dio when we've done it together, folks, In the last days of the campaign, I began thinking about him. That means a lot to me and my family, particularly my deceased son, Beau. It captures the faith that sustains may, which I believe sustains America, and I hope, and I hope it could provide some comfort and solace the 230,001,000 Americans who've lost a loved one to this terrible virus. This year, my heart goes out to each and every one of you. Hopefully this him gives you solace is well, it goes like this and he will raise you up on Eagles wings, bear you on the breath of dog and make you just sign like the sun and hold you in the palm of his hand. And now, together on Eagles wings, we embark on the work of that God and history of called upon us to dio with full heart and steady here with faith in America and each other with love of country A thirst for justice Let</p>
